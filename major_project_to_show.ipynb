WATSON, M.D.,\\r\\n_Late of the Army Medical Department._)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I.\\r\\nMR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\\r\\nUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\\r\\nprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\\r\\nI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\\r\\nSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I\\r\\ncould join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\\r\\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\\r\\nwas already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many\\r\\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\\r\\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\\r\\nentered upon my new duties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\\r\\nnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\\r\\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\\r\\nMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\\r\\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\\r\\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\\r\\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\\r\\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\\r\\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\\r\\nthe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\\r\\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\\r\\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\\r\\nof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\\r\\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak\\r\\nand emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be\\r\\nlost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in\\r\\nthe troopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty,\\r\\nwith my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a\\r\\npaternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to\\r\\nimprove it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\\r\\nair—or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\\r\\npermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\\r\\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\\r\\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a\\r\\nprivate hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\\r\\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\\r\\nthan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I\\r\\nsoon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\\r\\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\\r\\nmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\\r\\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\\r\\npretentious and less expensive domicile.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\\r\\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\\r\\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\\r\\nBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London\\r\\nis a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had\\r\\nnever been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with\\r\\nenthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In\\r\\nthe exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn,\\r\\nand we started off together in a hansom.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in\\r\\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\\r\\n“You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\\r\\nby the time that we reached our destination.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\\r\\nmisfortunes. “What are you up to now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Looking for lodgings,” I answered. “Trying to solve the problem as to\\r\\nwhether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second\\r\\nman to-day that has used that expression to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And who was the first?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\\r\\nHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\\r\\nto go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\\r\\nwere too much for his purse.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\\r\\nthe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a\\r\\npartner to being alone.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You\\r\\ndon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\\r\\nfor him as a constant companion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, what is there against him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\\r\\nin his ideas—an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\\r\\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No—I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\\r\\nup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\\r\\nhe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\\r\\nvery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the\\r\\nway knowledge which would astonish his professors.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\\r\\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I\\r\\nshould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\\r\\nenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\\r\\nAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\\r\\ncould I meet this friend of yours?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion. “He either\\r\\navoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\\r\\nnight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\\r\\nchannels.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\\r\\ngave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\\r\\ntake as a fellow-lodger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I know\\r\\nnothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally\\r\\nin the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold\\r\\nme responsible.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered. “It\\r\\nseems to me, Stamford,” I added, looking hard at my companion, “that\\r\\nyou have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this\\r\\nfellow’s temper so formidable, or what is it? Don’t be mealy-mouthed\\r\\nabout it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is not easy to express the inexpressible,” he answered with a\\r\\nlaugh. “Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes—it approaches\\r\\nto cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch\\r\\nof the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you\\r\\nunderstand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an\\r\\naccurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would\\r\\ntake it himself with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion\\r\\nfor definite and exact knowledge.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very right too.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the\\r\\nsubjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking\\r\\nrather a bizarre shape.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Beating the subjects!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him\\r\\nat it with my own eyes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And yet you say he is not a medical student?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are,\\r\\nand you must form your own impressions about him.” As he spoke, we\\r\\nturned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which\\r\\nopened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me,\\r\\nand I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and\\r\\nmade our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall\\r\\nand dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage\\r\\nbranched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.\\r\\nBroad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,\\r\\ntest-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.\\r\\nThere was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant\\r\\ntable absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round\\r\\nand sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. “I’ve found it! I’ve\\r\\nfound it,” he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a\\r\\ntest-tube in his hand. “I have found a re-agent which is precipitated\\r\\nby hæmoglobin, and by nothing else.” Had he discovered a gold mine,\\r\\ngreater delight could not have shone upon his features.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said Stamford, introducing us.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How are you?” he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for\\r\\nwhich I should hardly have given him credit. “You have been in\\r\\nAfghanistan, I perceive.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How on earth did you know that?” I asked in astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never mind,” said he, chuckling to himself. “The question now is about\\r\\nhæmoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of\\r\\nmine?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,” I answered, “but\\r\\npractically——”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.\\r\\nDon’t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains.\\r\\nCome over here now!” He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness,\\r\\nand drew me over to the table at which he had been working. “Let us\\r\\nhave some fresh blood,” he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger,\\r\\nand drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette.\\r\\n“Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You\\r\\nperceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water.\\r\\nThe proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no\\r\\ndoubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic\\r\\nreaction.” As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals,\\r\\nand then added some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the\\r\\ncontents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was\\r\\nprecipitated to the bottom of the glass jar.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ha! ha!” he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a\\r\\nchild with a new toy. “What do you think of that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It seems to be a very delicate test,” I remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and\\r\\nuncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The\\r\\nlatter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this\\r\\nappears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test\\r\\nbeen invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who\\r\\nwould long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed!” I murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is\\r\\nsuspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His\\r\\nlinen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon\\r\\nthem. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit\\r\\nstains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an\\r\\nexpert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the\\r\\nSherlock Holmes’ test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his\\r\\nheart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his\\r\\nimagination.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are to be congratulated,” I remarked, considerably surprised at\\r\\nhis enthusiasm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would\\r\\ncertainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there\\r\\nwas Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of\\r\\nMontpellier, and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases\\r\\nin which it would have been decisive.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,” said Stamford with a\\r\\nlaugh. “You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the ‘Police\\r\\nNews of the Past.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very interesting reading it might be made, too,” remarked Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger.\\r\\n“I have to be careful,” he continued, turning to me with a smile, “for\\r\\nI dabble with poisons a good deal.” He held out his hand as he spoke,\\r\\nand I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of\\r\\nplaster, and discoloured with strong acids.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We came here on business,” said Stamford, sitting down on a high\\r\\nthree-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his\\r\\nfoot. “My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were\\r\\ncomplaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought\\r\\nthat I had better bring you together.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with\\r\\nme. “I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,” he said, “which would\\r\\nsuit us down to the ground. You don’t mind the smell of strong tobacco,\\r\\nI hope?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I always smoke ‘ship’s’ myself,” I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally\\r\\ndo experiments. Would that annoy you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By no means.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me see—what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at\\r\\ntimes, and don’t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am\\r\\nsulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I’ll soon be right. What\\r\\nhave you to confess now? It’s just as well for two fellows to know the\\r\\nworst of one another before they begin to live together.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI laughed at this cross-examination. “I keep a bull pup,” I said, “and\\r\\nI object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all\\r\\nsorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of\\r\\nvices when I’m well, but those are the principal ones at present.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?” he asked,\\r\\nanxiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It depends on the player,” I answered. “A well-played violin is a\\r\\ntreat for the gods—a badly-played one——”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, that’s all right,” he cried, with a merry laugh. “I think we may\\r\\nconsider the thing as settled—that is, if the rooms are agreeable to\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When shall we see them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we’ll go together and settle\\r\\neverything,” he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right—noon exactly,” said I, shaking his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards\\r\\nmy hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\n“By the way,” I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford,\\r\\n“how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy companion smiled an enigmatical smile. “That’s just his little\\r\\npeculiarity,” he said. “A good many people have wanted to know how he\\r\\nfinds things out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! a mystery is it?” I cried, rubbing my hands. “This is very\\r\\npiquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. ‘The proper\\r\\nstudy of mankind is man,’ you know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must study him, then,” Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.\\r\\n“You’ll find him a knotty problem, though. I’ll wager he learns more\\r\\nabout you than you about him. Good-bye.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-bye,” I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably\\r\\ninterested in my new acquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II.\\r\\nTHE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No.\\r\\n221B, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They\\r\\nconsisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy\\r\\nsitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad\\r\\nwindows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate\\r\\ndid the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was\\r\\nconcluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That\\r\\nvery evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the\\r\\nfollowing morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and\\r\\nportmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and\\r\\nlaying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually\\r\\nbegan to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new\\r\\nsurroundings.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in\\r\\nhis ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up\\r\\nafter ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out\\r\\nbefore I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the\\r\\nchemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and\\r\\noccasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest\\r\\nportions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working\\r\\nfit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for\\r\\ndays on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly\\r\\nuttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these\\r\\noccasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes,\\r\\nthat I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some\\r\\nnarcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life\\r\\nforbidden such a notion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his\\r\\naims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and\\r\\nappearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual\\r\\nobserver. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively\\r\\nlean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and\\r\\npiercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have\\r\\nalluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air\\r\\nof alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and\\r\\nsquareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were\\r\\ninvariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was\\r\\npossessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had\\r\\noccasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile\\r\\nphilosophical instruments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how\\r\\nmuch this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to\\r\\nbreak through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned\\r\\nhimself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how\\r\\nobjectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my\\r\\nattention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather\\r\\nwas exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me\\r\\nand break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these\\r\\ncircumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my\\r\\ncompanion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,\\r\\nconfirmed Stamford’s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to\\r\\nhave pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in\\r\\nscience or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance\\r\\ninto the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was\\r\\nremarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so\\r\\nextraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly\\r\\nastounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise\\r\\ninformation unless he had some definite end in view. Desultory readers\\r\\nare seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No man\\r\\nburdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason\\r\\nfor doing so.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary\\r\\nliterature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to\\r\\nnothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way\\r\\nwho he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax,\\r\\nhowever, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the\\r\\nCopernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. That any\\r\\ncivilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware\\r\\nthat the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an\\r\\nextraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You appear to be astonished,” he said, smiling at my expression of\\r\\nsurprise. “Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To forget it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You see,” he explained, “I consider that a man’s brain originally is\\r\\nlike a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture\\r\\nas you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he\\r\\ncomes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets\\r\\ncrowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so\\r\\nthat he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful\\r\\nworkman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his\\r\\nbrain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in\\r\\ndoing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the\\r\\nmost perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has\\r\\nelastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes\\r\\na time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that\\r\\nyou knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to\\r\\nhave useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the Solar System!” I protested.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What the deuce is it to me?” he interrupted impatiently; “you say that\\r\\nwe go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a\\r\\npennyworth of difference to me or to my work.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something\\r\\nin his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I\\r\\npondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw\\r\\nmy deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which\\r\\ndid not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he\\r\\npossessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own\\r\\nmind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was\\r\\nexceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down.\\r\\nI could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It\\r\\nran in this way—\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSHERLOCK HOLMES—his limits.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Knowledge of Literature.—Nil.\\r\\n2. Philosophy.—Nil.\\r\\n3. Astronomy.—Nil.\\r\\n4. Politics.—Feeble.\\r\\n5. Botany.—Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons\\r\\ngenerally. Knows nothing of practical gardening.\\r\\n6. Geology.—Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different soils\\r\\nfrom each other. After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers,\\r\\nand told me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he\\r\\nhad received them.\\r\\n7. Chemistry.—Profound.\\r\\n8. Anatomy.—Accurate, but unsystematic.\\r\\n9. Sensational Literature.—Immense. He appears to know every detail of\\r\\nevery horror perpetrated in the century.\\r\\n10. Plays the violin well.\\r\\n11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.\\r\\n12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair.\\r\\n“If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all\\r\\nthese accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,”\\r\\nI said to myself, “I may as well give up the attempt at once.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These\\r\\nwere very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other\\r\\naccomplishments. That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I\\r\\nknew well, because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn’s\\r\\nLieder, and other favourites. When left to himself, however, he would\\r\\nseldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in\\r\\nhis arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape\\r\\ncarelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes\\r\\nthe chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were\\r\\nfantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which\\r\\npossessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether\\r\\nthe playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I\\r\\ncould determine. I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos\\r\\nhad it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick\\r\\nsuccession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation\\r\\nfor the trial upon my patience.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think\\r\\nthat my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently,\\r\\nhowever, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most\\r\\ndifferent classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced,\\r\\ndark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came\\r\\nthree or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called,\\r\\nfashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same\\r\\nafternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew\\r\\npedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely\\r\\nfollowed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old\\r\\nwhite-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on\\r\\nanother a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these\\r\\nnondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to\\r\\nbeg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room.\\r\\nHe always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. “I\\r\\nhave to use this room as a place of business,” he said, “and these\\r\\npeople are my clients.” Again I had an opportunity of asking him a\\r\\npoint blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing\\r\\nanother man to confide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some\\r\\nstrong reason for not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by\\r\\ncoming round to the subject of his own accord.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I\\r\\nrose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had\\r\\nnot yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed\\r\\nto my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee\\r\\nprepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell\\r\\nand gave a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a\\r\\nmagazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it,\\r\\nwhile my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the articles\\r\\nhad a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye\\r\\nthrough it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts somewhat ambitious title was “The Book of Life,” and it attempted\\r\\nto show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and\\r\\nsystematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as\\r\\nbeing a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The\\r\\nreasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to\\r\\nbe far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary\\r\\nexpression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a\\r\\nman’s inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility\\r\\nin the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions\\r\\nwere as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling\\r\\nwould his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the\\r\\nprocesses by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him\\r\\nas a necromancer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“From a drop of water,” said the writer, “a logician could infer the\\r\\npossibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of\\r\\none or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is\\r\\nknown whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts,\\r\\nthe Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired\\r\\nby long and patient study nor, is life long enough to allow any mortal\\r\\nto attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to\\r\\nthose moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest\\r\\ndifficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary\\r\\nproblems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to\\r\\ndistinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to\\r\\nwhich he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the\\r\\nfaculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to\\r\\nlook for. By a man’s finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by\\r\\nhis trouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by\\r\\nhis expression, by his shirt cuffs—by each of these things a man’s\\r\\ncalling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten\\r\\nthe competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What ineffable twaddle!” I cried, slapping the magazine down on the\\r\\ntable, “I never read such rubbish in my life.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, this article,” I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat\\r\\ndown to my breakfast. “I see that you have read it since you have\\r\\nmarked it. I don’t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me\\r\\nthough. It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who\\r\\nevolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own\\r\\nstudy. It is not practical. I should like to see him clapped down in a\\r\\nthird class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades\\r\\nof all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against\\r\\nhim.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You would lose your money,” Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. “As for\\r\\nthe article I wrote it myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The\\r\\ntheories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so\\r\\nchimerical are really extremely practical—so practical that I depend\\r\\nupon them for my bread and cheese.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how?” I asked involuntarily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the\\r\\nworld. I’m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is.\\r\\nHere in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of\\r\\nprivate ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I\\r\\nmanage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before\\r\\nme, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history\\r\\nof crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance\\r\\nabout misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your\\r\\nfinger ends, it is odd if you can’t unravel the thousand and first.\\r\\nLestrade is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently\\r\\nover a forgery case, and that was what brought him here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And these other people?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all\\r\\npeople who are in trouble about something, and want a little\\r\\nenlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and\\r\\nthen I pocket my fee.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But do you mean to say,” I said, “that without leaving your room you\\r\\ncan unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although\\r\\nthey have seen every detail for themselves?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case\\r\\nturns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about\\r\\nand see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special\\r\\nknowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters\\r\\nwonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which\\r\\naroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation\\r\\nwith me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you,\\r\\non our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You were told, no doubt.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing of the sort. I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan. From long\\r\\nhabit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I\\r\\narrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate\\r\\nsteps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran,\\r\\n‘Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military\\r\\nman. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics,\\r\\nfor his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for\\r\\nhis wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his\\r\\nhaggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it\\r\\nin a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English\\r\\narmy doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in\\r\\nAfghanistan.’ The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I\\r\\nthen remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is simple enough as you explain it,” I said, smiling. “You remind\\r\\nme of Edgar Allen Poe’s Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did\\r\\nexist outside of stories.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. “No doubt you think that you are\\r\\ncomplimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,” he observed. “Now, in my\\r\\nopinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of\\r\\nbreaking in on his friends’ thoughts with an apropos remark after a\\r\\nquarter of an hour’s silence is really very showy and superficial. He\\r\\nhad some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a\\r\\nphenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you read Gaboriau’s works?” I asked. “Does Lecoq come up to your\\r\\nidea of a detective?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. “Lecoq was a miserable bungler,”\\r\\nhe said, in an angry voice; “he had only one thing to recommend him,\\r\\nand that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question\\r\\nwas how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in\\r\\ntwenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a\\r\\ntext-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired\\r\\ntreated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood\\r\\nlooking out into the busy street. “This fellow may be very clever,” I\\r\\nsaid to myself, “but he is certainly very conceited.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,” he said,\\r\\nquerulously. “What is the use of having brains in our profession. I\\r\\nknow well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or\\r\\nhas ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural\\r\\ntalent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the\\r\\nresult? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling\\r\\nvillainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard\\r\\nofficial can see through it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought\\r\\nit best to change the topic.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wonder what that fellow is looking for?” I asked, pointing to a\\r\\nstalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the\\r\\nother side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had a\\r\\nlarge blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a\\r\\nmessage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,” said Sherlock Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Brag and bounce!” thought I to myself. “He knows that I cannot verify\\r\\nhis guess.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were\\r\\nwatching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across\\r\\nthe roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps\\r\\nascending the stair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” he said, stepping into the room and handing\\r\\nmy friend the letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little\\r\\nthought of this when he made that random shot. “May I ask, my lad,” I\\r\\nsaid, in the blandest voice, “what your trade may be?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Commissionaire, sir,” he said, gruffly. “Uniform away for repairs.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you were?” I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my\\r\\ncompanion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right,\\r\\nsir.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was\\r\\ngone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III.\\r\\nTHE LAURISTON GARDENS MYSTERY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI confess that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the\\r\\npractical nature of my companion’s theories. My respect for his powers\\r\\nof analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking\\r\\nsuspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged\\r\\nepisode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could\\r\\nhave in taking me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him he\\r\\nhad finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant,\\r\\nlack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How in the world did you deduce that?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Deduce what?” said he, petulantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have no time for trifles,” he answered, brusquely; then with a\\r\\nsmile, “Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but\\r\\nperhaps it is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that\\r\\nman was a sergeant of Marines?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, indeed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you were\\r\\nasked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some\\r\\ndifficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the\\r\\nstreet I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the\\r\\nfellow’s hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage,\\r\\nhowever, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was\\r\\na man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command.\\r\\nYou must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his\\r\\ncane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of\\r\\nhim—all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wonderful!” I ejaculated.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Commonplace,” said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that\\r\\nhe was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration. “I said just now\\r\\nthat there were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong—look at this!”\\r\\nHe threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why,” I cried, as I cast my eye over it, “this is terrible!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It does seem to be a little out of the common,” he remarked, calmly.\\r\\n“Would you mind reading it to me aloud?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the letter which I read to him—\\r\\n\\r\\n“MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—\\r\\n\\r\\n“There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston\\r\\nGardens, off the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there\\r\\nabout two in the morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected\\r\\nthat something was amiss. He found the door open, and in the front\\r\\nroom, which is bare of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman,\\r\\nwell dressed, and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of ‘Enoch\\r\\nJ. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.’ There had been no robbery, nor is\\r\\nthere any evidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of\\r\\nblood in the room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a\\r\\nloss as to how he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair\\r\\nis a puzzler. If you can come round to the house any time before\\r\\ntwelve, you will find me there. I have left everything _in statu quo_\\r\\nuntil I hear from you. If you are unable to come I shall give you\\r\\nfuller details, and would esteem it a great kindness if you would\\r\\nfavour me with your opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Yours faithfully,\\r\\n                  “TOBIAS GREGSON.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,” my friend remarked;\\r\\n“he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and\\r\\nenergetic, but conventional—shockingly so. They have their knives into\\r\\none another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional\\r\\nbeauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put\\r\\nupon the scent.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. “Surely there is\\r\\nnot a moment to be lost,” I cried, “shall I go and order you a cab?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy\\r\\ndevil that ever stood in shoe leather—that is, when the fit is on me,\\r\\nfor I can be spry enough at times.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel the\\r\\nwhole matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will\\r\\npocket all the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But he begs you to help him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but\\r\\nhe would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person.\\r\\nHowever, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my\\r\\nown hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that\\r\\nan energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get your hat,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You wish me to come?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, if you have nothing better to do.” A minute later we were both in\\r\\na hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the\\r\\nhouse-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets\\r\\nbeneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away\\r\\nabout Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and an\\r\\nAmati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the\\r\\nmelancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,” I said at\\r\\nlast, interrupting Holmes’ musical disquisition.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No data yet,” he answered. “It is a capital mistake to theorize before\\r\\nyou have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will have your data soon,” I remarked, pointing with my finger;\\r\\n“this is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much\\r\\nmistaken.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So it is. Stop, driver, stop!” We were still a hundred yards or so\\r\\nfrom it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our\\r\\njourney upon foot.\\r\\n\\r\\nNumber 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It\\r\\nwas one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two\\r\\nbeing occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of\\r\\nvacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here\\r\\nand there a “To Let” card had developed like a cataract upon the\\r\\nbleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption\\r\\nof sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and\\r\\nwas traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting\\r\\napparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very\\r\\nsloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was\\r\\nbounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the\\r\\ntop, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable,\\r\\nsurrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and\\r\\nstrained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the\\r\\nproceedings within.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the\\r\\nhouse and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be\\r\\nfurther from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the\\r\\ncircumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up\\r\\nand down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the\\r\\nopposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny,\\r\\nhe proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass\\r\\nwhich flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice\\r\\nhe stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an\\r\\nexclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon\\r\\nthe wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going\\r\\nover it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn\\r\\nanything from it. Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the\\r\\nquickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he\\r\\ncould see a great deal which was hidden from me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced,\\r\\nflaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and\\r\\nwrung my companion’s hand with effusion. “It is indeed kind of you to\\r\\ncome,” he said, “I have had everything left untouched.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Except that!” my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. “If a herd\\r\\nof buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No\\r\\ndoubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you\\r\\npermitted this.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have had so much to do inside the house,” the detective said\\r\\nevasively. “My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him\\r\\nto look after this.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. “With two\\r\\nsuch men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be\\r\\nmuch for a third party to find out,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nGregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. “I think we have done\\r\\nall that can be done,” he answered; “it’s a queer case though, and I\\r\\nknew your taste for such things.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You did not come here in a cab?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nor Lestrade?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then let us go and look at the room.” With which inconsequent remark\\r\\nhe strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features\\r\\nexpressed his astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nA short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and\\r\\noffices. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One\\r\\nof these had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged\\r\\nto the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious\\r\\naffair had occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that\\r\\nsubdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of\\r\\nall furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was\\r\\nblotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had\\r\\nbecome detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath.\\r\\nOpposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of\\r\\nimitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a\\r\\nred wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was\\r\\nhazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was\\r\\nintensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole\\r\\napartment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was\\r\\ncentred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon\\r\\nthe boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured\\r\\nceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of\\r\\nage, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and\\r\\na short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat\\r\\nand waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and\\r\\ncuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor\\r\\nbeside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while\\r\\nhis lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been\\r\\na grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror,\\r\\nand as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human\\r\\nfeatures. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low\\r\\nforehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a\\r\\nsingularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his\\r\\nwrithing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never\\r\\nhas it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy\\r\\napartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban\\r\\nLondon.\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway,\\r\\nand greeted my companion and myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This case will make a stir, sir,” he remarked. “It beats anything I\\r\\nhave seen, and I am no chicken.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is no clue?” said Gregson.\\r\\n\\r\\n“None at all,” chimed in Lestrade.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it\\r\\nintently. “You are sure that there is no wound?” he asked, pointing to\\r\\nnumerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Positive!” cried both detectives.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual—presumably\\r\\nthe murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of the\\r\\ncircumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the\\r\\nyear ‘34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Read it up—you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It\\r\\nhas all been done before.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and\\r\\neverywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes\\r\\nwore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon.\\r\\nSo swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed\\r\\nthe minuteness with which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the\\r\\ndead man’s lips, and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather\\r\\nboots.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has not been moved at all?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can take him to the mortuary now,” he said. “There is nothing more\\r\\nto be learned.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered\\r\\nthe room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised\\r\\nhim, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed\\r\\nit up and stared at it with mystified eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s been a woman here,” he cried. “It’s a woman’s wedding-ring.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered\\r\\nround him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of\\r\\nplain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This complicates matters,” said Gregson. “Heaven knows, they were\\r\\ncomplicated enough before.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re sure it doesn’t simplify them?” observed Holmes. “There’s\\r\\nnothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his\\r\\npockets?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have it all here,” said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects\\r\\nupon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. “A gold watch, No. 97163,\\r\\nby Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold\\r\\nring, with masonic device. Gold pin—bull-dog’s head, with rubies as\\r\\neyes. Russian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of\\r\\nCleveland, corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse,\\r\\nbut loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition\\r\\nof Boccaccio’s _Decameron_, with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the\\r\\nfly-leaf. Two letters—one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph\\r\\nStangerson.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“At what address?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“American Exchange, Strand—to be left till called for. They are both\\r\\nfrom the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their\\r\\nboats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about\\r\\nto return to New York.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I did it at once, sir,” said Gregson. “I have had advertisements sent\\r\\nto all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American\\r\\nExchange, but he has not returned yet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you sent to Cleveland?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We telegraphed this morning.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How did you word your inquiries?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad\\r\\nof any information which could help us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to\\r\\nbe crucial?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I asked about Stangerson.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case\\r\\nappears to hinge? Will you not telegraph again?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have said all I have to say,” said Gregson, in an offended voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make\\r\\nsome remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we\\r\\nwere holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene,\\r\\nrubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Gregson,” he said, “I have just made a discovery of the highest\\r\\nimportance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a\\r\\ncareful examination of the walls.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little man’s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a\\r\\nstate of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his\\r\\ncolleague.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come here,” he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of\\r\\nwhich felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. “Now, stand\\r\\nthere!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look at that!” he said, triumphantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this\\r\\nparticular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a\\r\\nyellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was\\r\\nscrawled in blood-red letters a single word—\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRACHE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you think of that?” cried the detective, with the air of a\\r\\nshowman exhibiting his show. “This was overlooked because it was in the\\r\\ndarkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The\\r\\nmurderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where\\r\\nit has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide\\r\\nanyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See\\r\\nthat candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was\\r\\nlit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion\\r\\nof the wall.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?” asked Gregson in\\r\\na depreciatory voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name\\r\\nRachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark\\r\\nmy words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a\\r\\nwoman named Rachel has something to do with it. It’s all very well for\\r\\nyou to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever,\\r\\nbut the old hound is the best, when all is said and done.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I really beg your pardon!” said my companion, who had ruffled the\\r\\nlittle man’s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. “You\\r\\ncertainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out,\\r\\nand, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the\\r\\nother participant in last night’s mystery. I have not had time to\\r\\nexamine this room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying\\r\\nglass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly\\r\\nabout the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once\\r\\nlying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that\\r\\nhe appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to\\r\\nhimself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of\\r\\nexclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of\\r\\nencouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded\\r\\nof a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and\\r\\nforwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes\\r\\nacross the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his\\r\\nresearches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between\\r\\nmarks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying\\r\\nhis tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one\\r\\nplace he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the\\r\\nfloor, and packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his\\r\\nglass the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the\\r\\nmost minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he\\r\\nreplaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,” he\\r\\nremarked with a smile. “It’s a very bad definition, but it does apply\\r\\nto detective work.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGregson and Lestrade had watched the manœuvres of their amateur\\r\\ncompanion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently\\r\\nfailed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that\\r\\nSherlock Holmes’ smallest actions were all directed towards some\\r\\ndefinite and practical end.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you think of it, sir?” they both asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume\\r\\nto help you,” remarked my friend. “You are doing so well now that it\\r\\nwould be a pity for anyone to interfere.” There was a world of sarcasm\\r\\nin his voice as he spoke. “If you will let me know how your\\r\\ninvestigations go,” he continued, “I shall be happy to give you any\\r\\nhelp I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who\\r\\nfound the body. Can you give me his name and address?”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade glanced at his note-book. “John Rance,” he said. “He is off\\r\\nduty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes took a note of the address.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come along, Doctor,” he said; “we shall go and look him up. I’ll tell\\r\\nyou one thing which may help you in the case,” he continued, turning to\\r\\nthe two detectives. “There has been murder done, and the murderer was a\\r\\nman. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had\\r\\nsmall feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a\\r\\nTrichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab,\\r\\nwhich was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his\\r\\noff fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and\\r\\nthe finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only\\r\\na few indications, but they may assist you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If this man was murdered, how was it done?” asked the former.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poison,” said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. “One other\\r\\nthing, Lestrade,” he added, turning round at the door: “‘Rache,’ is the\\r\\nGerman for ‘revenge;’ so don’t lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWith which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals\\r\\nopen-mouthed behind him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV.\\r\\nWHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was one o’clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a\\r\\nlong telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us\\r\\nto the address given us by Lestrade.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is nothing like first hand evidence,” he remarked; “as a matter\\r\\nof fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as\\r\\nwell learn all that is to be learned.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You amaze me, Holmes,” said I. “Surely you are not as sure as you\\r\\npretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s no room for a mistake,” he answered. “The very first thing\\r\\nwhich I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts\\r\\nwith its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had\\r\\nno rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep\\r\\nimpression must have been there during the night. There were the marks\\r\\nof the horse’s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more\\r\\nclearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new\\r\\nshoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there\\r\\nat any time during the morning—I have Gregson’s word for that—it\\r\\nfollows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore,\\r\\nthat it brought those two individuals to the house.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That seems simple enough,” said I; “but how about the other man’s\\r\\nheight?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from\\r\\nthe length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though\\r\\nthere is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow’s stride\\r\\nboth on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of\\r\\nchecking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct\\r\\nleads him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing\\r\\nwas just over six feet from the ground. It was child’s play.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And his age?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest\\r\\neffort, he can’t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth\\r\\nof a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across.\\r\\nPatent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over.\\r\\nThere is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary\\r\\nlife a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I\\r\\nadvocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,” I suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The writing on the wall was done with a man’s forefinger dipped in\\r\\nblood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly\\r\\nscratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man’s\\r\\nnail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor.\\r\\nIt was dark in colour and flakey—such an ash as is only made by a\\r\\nTrichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes—in fact, I\\r\\nhave written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can\\r\\ndistinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar or\\r\\nof tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective\\r\\ndiffers from the Gregson and Lestrade type.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the florid face?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was\\r\\nright. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI passed my hand over my brow. “My head is in a whirl,” I remarked;\\r\\n“the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these\\r\\ntwo men—if there were two men—into an empty house? What has become of\\r\\nthe cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take\\r\\npoison? Where did the blood come from? What was the object of the\\r\\nmurderer, since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman’s ring\\r\\nthere? Above all, why should the second man write up the German word\\r\\nRACHE before decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of\\r\\nreconciling all these facts.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy companion smiled approvingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,” he\\r\\nsaid. “There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up\\r\\nmy mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade’s discovery it was\\r\\nsimply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by\\r\\nsuggesting Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German.\\r\\nThe A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion.\\r\\nNow, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we\\r\\nmay safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy\\r\\nimitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry\\r\\ninto a wrong channel. I’m not going to tell you much more of the case,\\r\\nDoctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained\\r\\nhis trick, and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will\\r\\ncome to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall never do that,” I answered; “you have brought detection as\\r\\nnear an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way\\r\\nin which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as\\r\\nsensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of\\r\\nher beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll tell you one other thing,” he said. “Patent-leathers and\\r\\nSquare-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway\\r\\ntogether as friendly as possible—arm-in-arm, in all probability. When\\r\\nthey got inside they walked up and down the room—or rather,\\r\\nPatent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I\\r\\ncould read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he\\r\\ngrew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of\\r\\nhis strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no\\r\\ndoubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I’ve told you all I know\\r\\nmyself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good\\r\\nworking basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want\\r\\nto go to Halle’s concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way\\r\\nthrough a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the\\r\\ndingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand.\\r\\n“That’s Audley Court in there,” he said, pointing to a narrow slit in\\r\\nthe line of dead-coloured brick. “You’ll find me here when you come\\r\\nback.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAudley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us\\r\\ninto a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We\\r\\npicked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of\\r\\ndiscoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was\\r\\ndecorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was\\r\\nengraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we\\r\\nwere shown into a little front parlour to await his coming.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in\\r\\nhis slumbers. “I made my report at the office,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it\\r\\npensively. “We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own\\r\\nlips,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,” the constable\\r\\nanswered with his eyes upon the little golden disk.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though\\r\\ndetermined not to omit anything in his narrative.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll tell it ye from the beginning,” he said. “My time is from ten at\\r\\nnight to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the ‘White\\r\\nHart’; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o’clock it\\r\\nbegan to rain, and I met Harry Murcher—him who has the Holland Grove\\r\\nbeat—and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin’.\\r\\nPresently—maybe about two or a little after—I thought I would take a\\r\\nlook round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was\\r\\nprecious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down,\\r\\nthough a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin’ down, thinkin’\\r\\nbetween ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when\\r\\nsuddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same\\r\\nhouse. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty\\r\\non account of him that owns them who won’t have the drains seen to,\\r\\nthough the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o’ typhoid\\r\\nfever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the\\r\\nwindow, and I suspected as something was wrong. When I got to the\\r\\ndoor——”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,” my companion\\r\\ninterrupted. “What did you do that for?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the\\r\\nutmost amazement upon his features.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, that’s true, sir,” he said; “though how you come to know it,\\r\\nHeaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still\\r\\nand so lonesome, that I thought I’d be none the worse for some one with\\r\\nme. I ain’t afeared of anything on this side o’ the grave; but I\\r\\nthought that maybe it was him that died o’ the typhoid inspecting the\\r\\ndrains what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o’ turn, and I\\r\\nwalked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher’s lantern, but\\r\\nthere wasn’t no sign of him nor of anyone else.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was no one in the street?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not a livin’ soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself\\r\\ntogether and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside,\\r\\nso I went into the room where the light was a-burnin’. There was a\\r\\ncandle flickerin’ on the mantelpiece—a red wax one—and by its light I\\r\\nsaw——”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times,\\r\\nand you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried\\r\\nthe kitchen door, and then——”\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in\\r\\nhis eyes. “Where was you hid to see all that?” he cried. “It seems to\\r\\nme that you knows a deal more than you should.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable.\\r\\n“Don’t get arresting me for the murder,” he said. “I am one of the\\r\\nhounds and not the wolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for\\r\\nthat. Go on, though. What did you do next?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified\\r\\nexpression. “I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That\\r\\nbrought Murcher and two more to the spot.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was the street empty then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe constable’s features broadened into a grin. “I’ve seen many a drunk\\r\\nchap in my time,” he said, “but never anyone so cryin’ drunk as that\\r\\ncove. He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin’ up agin the\\r\\nrailings, and a-singin’ at the pitch o’ his lungs about Columbine’s\\r\\nNew-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn’t stand, far less\\r\\nhelp.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What sort of a man was he?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. “He\\r\\nwas an uncommon drunk sort o’ man,” he said. “He’d ha’ found hisself in\\r\\nthe station if we hadn’t been so took up.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“His face—his dress—didn’t you notice them?” Holmes broke in\\r\\nimpatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up—me\\r\\nand Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower\\r\\npart muffled round——”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That will do,” cried Holmes. “What became of him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’d enough to do without lookin’ after him,” the policeman said, in\\r\\nan aggrieved voice. “I’ll wager he found his way home all right.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How was he dressed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A brown overcoat.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Had he a whip in his hand?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A whip—no.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He must have left it behind,” muttered my companion. “You didn’t\\r\\nhappen to see or hear a cab after that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s a half-sovereign for you,” my companion said, standing up and\\r\\ntaking his hat. “I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the\\r\\nforce. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. You\\r\\nmight have gained your sergeant’s stripes last night. The man whom you\\r\\nheld in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and\\r\\nwhom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell\\r\\nyou that it is so. Come along, Doctor.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous,\\r\\nbut obviously uncomfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The blundering fool,” Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our\\r\\nlodgings. “Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good\\r\\nluck, and not taking advantage of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of this\\r\\nman tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. But why\\r\\nshould he come back to the house after leaving it? That is not the way\\r\\nof criminals.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have no\\r\\nother way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. I\\r\\nshall have him, Doctor—I’ll lay you two to one that I have him. I must\\r\\nthank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you, and so have\\r\\nmissed the finest study I ever came across: a study in scarlet, eh? Why\\r\\nshouldn’t we use a little art jargon. There’s the scarlet thread of\\r\\nmurder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to\\r\\nunravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it. And now for\\r\\nlunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack and her bowing are\\r\\nsplendid. What’s that little thing of Chopin’s she plays so\\r\\nmagnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a\\r\\nlark while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V.\\r\\nOUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOur morning’s exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was\\r\\ntired out in the afternoon. After Holmes’ departure for the concert, I\\r\\nlay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours’ sleep.\\r\\nIt was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that\\r\\nhad occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it.\\r\\nEvery time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted\\r\\nbaboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the\\r\\nimpression which that face had produced upon me that I found it\\r\\ndifficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its\\r\\nowner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most\\r\\nmalignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of\\r\\nCleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the\\r\\ndepravity of the victim was no condonement in the eyes of the law.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion’s\\r\\nhypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he\\r\\nhad sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something\\r\\nwhich had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what had\\r\\ncaused the man’s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of\\r\\nstrangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay\\r\\nso thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had\\r\\nthe victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist.\\r\\nAs long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would\\r\\nbe no easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet\\r\\nself-confident manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory\\r\\nwhich explained all the facts, though what it was I could not for an\\r\\ninstant conjecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was very late in returning—so late, that I knew that the concert\\r\\ncould not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table\\r\\nbefore he appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was magnificent,” he said, as he took his seat. “Do you remember\\r\\nwhat Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and\\r\\nappreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of\\r\\nspeech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced\\r\\nby it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries\\r\\nwhen the world was in its childhood.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s rather a broad idea,” I remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“One’s ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret\\r\\nNature,” he answered. “What’s the matter? You’re not looking quite\\r\\nyourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To tell the truth, it has,” I said. “I ought to be more case-hardened\\r\\nafter my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at\\r\\nMaiwand without losing my nerve.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the\\r\\nimagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you\\r\\nseen the evening paper?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the\\r\\nfact that when the man was raised up, a woman’s wedding ring fell upon\\r\\nthe floor. It is just as well it does not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look at this advertisement,” he answered. “I had one sent to every\\r\\npaper this morning immediately after the affair.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated.\\r\\nIt was the first announcement in the “Found” column. “In Brixton Road,\\r\\nthis morning,” it ran, “a plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway\\r\\nbetween the ‘White Hart’ Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson,\\r\\n221B, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excuse my using your name,” he said. “If I used my own some of these\\r\\ndunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is all right,” I answered. “But supposing anyone applies, I have\\r\\nno ring.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh yes, you have,” said he, handing me one. “This will do very well.\\r\\nIt is almost a facsimile.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And who do you expect will answer this advertisement.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, the man in the brown coat—our florid friend with the square toes.\\r\\nIf he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Would he not consider it as too dangerous?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason\\r\\nto believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose\\r\\nthe ring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over\\r\\nDrebber’s body, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the\\r\\nhouse he discovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police\\r\\nalready in possession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle\\r\\nburning. He had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions\\r\\nwhich might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put\\r\\nyourself in that man’s place. On thinking the matter over, it must have\\r\\noccurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the\\r\\nroad after leaving the house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly\\r\\nlook out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the\\r\\narticles found. His eye, of course, would light upon this. He would be\\r\\noverjoyed. Why should he fear a trap? There would be no reason in his\\r\\neyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder.\\r\\nHe would come. He will come. You shall see him within an hour?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And then?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man, and\\r\\nthough I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for\\r\\nanything.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with the\\r\\npistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his\\r\\nfavourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The plot thickens,” he said, as I entered; “I have just had an answer\\r\\nto my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And that is?” I asked eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My fiddle would be the better for new strings,” he remarked. “Put your\\r\\npistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an\\r\\nordinary way. Leave the rest to me. Don’t frighten him by looking at\\r\\nhim too hard.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is eight o’clock now,” I said, glancing at my watch.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door\\r\\nslightly. That will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you! This\\r\\nis a queer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday—‘De Jure inter\\r\\nGentes’—published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642. Charles’\\r\\nhead was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown-backed\\r\\nvolume was struck off.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who is the printer?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Philippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the fly-leaf, in very\\r\\nfaded ink, is written ‘Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.’ I wonder who William\\r\\nWhyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His\\r\\nwriting has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose\\r\\nsoftly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the\\r\\nservant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she\\r\\nopened it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Does Dr. Watson live here?” asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We\\r\\ncould not hear the servant’s reply, but the door closed, and some one\\r\\nbegan to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling\\r\\none. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he\\r\\nlistened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a\\r\\nfeeble tap at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come in,” I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very\\r\\nold and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be\\r\\ndazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she\\r\\nstood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket\\r\\nwith nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face\\r\\nhad assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do\\r\\nto keep my countenance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our\\r\\nadvertisement. “It’s this as has brought me, good gentlemen,” she said,\\r\\ndropping another curtsey; “a gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road. It\\r\\nbelongs to my girl Sally, as was married only this time twelvemonth,\\r\\nwhich her husband is steward aboard a Union boat, and what he’d say if\\r\\nhe come ‘ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think,\\r\\nhe being short enough at the best o’ times, but more especially when he\\r\\nhas the drink. If it please you, she went to the circus last night\\r\\nalong with——”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is that her ring?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Lord be thanked!” cried the old woman; “Sally will be a glad woman\\r\\nthis night. That’s the ring.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what may your address be?” I inquired, taking up a pencil.\\r\\n\\r\\n“13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,”\\r\\nsaid Sherlock Holmes sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little\\r\\nred-rimmed eyes. “The gentleman asked me for _my_ address,” she said.\\r\\n“Sally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And your name is——?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My name is Sawyer—her’s is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her—and a\\r\\nsmart, clean lad, too, as long as he’s at sea, and no steward in the\\r\\ncompany more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and\\r\\nwhat with liquor shops——”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,” I interrupted, in obedience to a sign\\r\\nfrom my companion; “it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad\\r\\nto be able to restore it to the rightful owner.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWith many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old\\r\\ncrone packed it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs.\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and\\r\\nrushed into his room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an\\r\\nulster and a cravat. “I’ll follow her,” he said, hurriedly; “she must\\r\\nbe an accomplice, and will lead me to him. Wait up for me.” The hall\\r\\ndoor had hardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended\\r\\nthe stair. Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly\\r\\nalong the other side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance\\r\\nbehind. “Either his whole theory is incorrect,” I thought to myself,\\r\\n“or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery.” There was no\\r\\nneed for him to ask me to wait up for him, for I felt that sleep was\\r\\nimpossible until I heard the result of his adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was close upon nine when he set out. I had no idea how long he might\\r\\nbe, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages\\r\\nof Henri Murger’s “Vie de Bohème.” Ten o’clock passed, and I heard the\\r\\nfootsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven, and the more\\r\\nstately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same\\r\\ndestination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of\\r\\nhis latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not\\r\\nbeen successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the\\r\\nmastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a\\r\\nhearty laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wouldn’t have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,” he cried,\\r\\ndropping into his chair; “I have chaffed them so much that they would\\r\\nnever have let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh, because I\\r\\nknow that I will be even with them in the long run.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it then?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I don’t mind telling a story against myself. That creature had\\r\\ngone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being\\r\\nfoot-sore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler\\r\\nwhich was passing. I managed to be close to her so as to hear the\\r\\naddress, but I need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud\\r\\nenough to be heard at the other side of the street, ‘Drive to 13,\\r\\nDuncan Street, Houndsditch,’ she cried. This begins to look genuine, I\\r\\nthought, and having seen her safely inside, I perched myself behind.\\r\\nThat’s an art which every detective should be an expert at. Well, away\\r\\nwe rattled, and never drew rein until we reached the street in\\r\\nquestion. I hopped off before we came to the door, and strolled down\\r\\nthe street in an easy, lounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver\\r\\njumped down, and I saw him open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing\\r\\ncame out though. When I reached him he was groping about frantically in\\r\\nthe empty cab, and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of\\r\\noaths that ever I listened to. There was no sign or trace of his\\r\\npassenger, and I fear it will be some time before he gets his fare. On\\r\\ninquiring at Number 13 we found that the house belonged to a\\r\\nrespectable paperhanger, named Keswick, and that no one of the name\\r\\neither of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t mean to say,” I cried, in amazement, “that that tottering,\\r\\nfeeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion,\\r\\nwithout either you or the driver seeing her?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Old woman be damned!” said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. “We were the old\\r\\nwomen to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an active\\r\\none, too, besides being an incomparable actor. The get-up was\\r\\ninimitable. He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this means\\r\\nof giving me the slip. It shows that the man we are after is not as\\r\\nlonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who are ready to risk\\r\\nsomething for him. Now, Doctor, you are looking done-up. Take my advice\\r\\nand turn in.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. I left\\r\\nHolmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the\\r\\nwatches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his\\r\\nviolin, and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem\\r\\nwhich he had set himself to unravel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI.\\r\\nTOBIAS GREGSON SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe papers next day were full of the “Brixton Mystery,” as they termed\\r\\nit. Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it\\r\\nin addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I\\r\\nstill retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing\\r\\nupon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:—\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had\\r\\nseldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German\\r\\nname of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister\\r\\ninscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political\\r\\nrefugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in\\r\\nAmerica, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten\\r\\nlaws, and been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the\\r\\nVehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers,\\r\\nthe Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff\\r\\nHighway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government\\r\\nand advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the\\r\\nsort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from\\r\\nthe unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening\\r\\nof all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had been\\r\\nresiding for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the\\r\\nboarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell.\\r\\nHe was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph\\r\\nStangerson. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th\\r\\ninst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of\\r\\ncatching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together upon\\r\\nthe platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber’s body\\r\\nwas, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road,\\r\\nmany miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are\\r\\nquestions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the\\r\\nwhereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and\\r\\nMr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it\\r\\nis confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily\\r\\nthrow light upon the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being\\r\\na political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated\\r\\nthe Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores\\r\\na number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not\\r\\nsoured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these\\r\\nmen there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was\\r\\npunished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary,\\r\\nStangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the\\r\\ndeceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address\\r\\nof the house at which he had boarded—a result which was entirely due to\\r\\nthe acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast,\\r\\nand they appeared to afford him considerable amusement.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure\\r\\nto score.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That depends on how it turns out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, bless you, it doesn’t matter in the least. If the man is caught,\\r\\nit will be _on account_ of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be\\r\\n_in spite_ of their exertions. It’s heads I win and tails you lose.\\r\\nWhatever they do, they will have followers. ‘Un sot trouve toujours un\\r\\nplus sot qui l’admire.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What on earth is this?” I cried, for at this moment there came the\\r\\npattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by\\r\\naudible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s the Baker Street division of the detective police force,” said my\\r\\ncompanion, gravely; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a\\r\\ndozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped\\r\\neyes on.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Tention!” cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little\\r\\nscoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes. “In\\r\\nfuture you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you\\r\\nmust wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir, we hain’t,” said one of the youths.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are\\r\\nyour wages.” He handed each of them a shilling.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many\\r\\nrats, and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than\\r\\nout of a dozen of the force,” Holmes remarked. “The mere sight of an\\r\\nofficial-looking person seals men’s lips. These youngsters, however, go\\r\\neverywhere and hear everything. They are as sharp as needles, too; all\\r\\nthey want is organisation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matter\\r\\nof time. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance!\\r\\nHere is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every\\r\\nfeature of his face. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There\\r\\nhe is!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the\\r\\nfair-haired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and\\r\\nburst into our sitting-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear fellow,” he cried, wringing Holmes’ unresponsive hand,\\r\\n“congratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion’s expressive\\r\\nface.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you mean that you are on the right track?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And his name is?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty’s navy,” cried\\r\\nGregson, pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Take a seat, and try one of these cigars,” he said. “We are anxious to\\r\\nknow how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t mind if I do,” the detective answered. “The tremendous\\r\\nexertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have\\r\\nworn me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain\\r\\nupon the mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we\\r\\nare both brain-workers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You do me too much honour,” said Holmes, gravely. “Let us hear how you\\r\\narrived at this most gratifying result.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently\\r\\nat his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of\\r\\namusement.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The fun of it is,” he cried, “that that fool Lestrade, who thinks\\r\\nhimself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is\\r\\nafter the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime\\r\\nthan the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this\\r\\ntime.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how did you get your clue?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, I’ll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is\\r\\nstrictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to\\r\\ncontend with was the finding of this American’s antecedents. Some\\r\\npeople would have waited until their advertisements were answered, or\\r\\nuntil parties came forward and volunteered information. That is not\\r\\nTobias Gregson’s way of going to work. You remember the hat beside the\\r\\ndead man?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Holmes; “by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGregson looked quite crest-fallen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had no idea that you noticed that,” he said. “Have you been there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ha!” cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; “you should never neglect a\\r\\nchance, however small it may seem.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To a great mind, nothing is little,” remarked Holmes, sententiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that\\r\\nsize and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once.\\r\\nHe had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier’s\\r\\nBoarding Establishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Smart—very smart!” murmured Sherlock Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I next called upon Madame Charpentier,” continued the detective. “I\\r\\nfound her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room,\\r\\ntoo—an uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was looking red about the\\r\\neyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. That didn’t escape my\\r\\nnotice. I began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes, when you come upon the right scent—a kind of thrill in your\\r\\nnerves. ‘Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder\\r\\nMr. Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?’ I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The mother nodded. She didn’t seem able to get out a word. The\\r\\ndaughter burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew\\r\\nsomething of the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘At what o’clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?’ I\\r\\nasked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘At eight o’clock,’ she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her\\r\\nagitation. ‘His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two\\r\\ntrains—one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘And was that the last which you saw of him?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“A terrible change came over the woman’s face as I asked the question.\\r\\nHer features turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she\\r\\ncould get out the single word ‘Yes’—and when it did come it was in a\\r\\nhusky unnatural tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm\\r\\nclear voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,’ she said. ‘Let us be\\r\\nfrank with this gentleman. We _did_ see Mr. Drebber again.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘God forgive you!’ cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and\\r\\nsinking back in her chair. ‘You have murdered your brother.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,’ the girl answered\\r\\nfirmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘You had best tell me all about it now,’ I said. ‘Half-confidences are\\r\\nworse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘On your head be it, Alice!’ cried her mother; and then, turning to\\r\\nme, ‘I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on\\r\\nbehalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in\\r\\nthis terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is,\\r\\nhowever, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to\\r\\nbe compromised. That however is surely impossible. His high character,\\r\\nhis profession, his antecedents would all forbid it.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,’ I answered.\\r\\n‘Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,’ she said, and her\\r\\ndaughter withdrew. ‘Now, sir,’ she continued, ‘I had no intention of\\r\\ntelling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I\\r\\nhave no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all\\r\\nwithout omitting any particular.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘It is your wisest course,’ said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his\\r\\nsecretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I\\r\\nnoticed a “Copenhagen” label upon each of their trunks, showing that\\r\\nthat had been their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet\\r\\nreserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise.\\r\\nHe was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. The very night of\\r\\nhis arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after\\r\\ntwelve o’clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober. His\\r\\nmanners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar.\\r\\nWorst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my\\r\\ndaughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way which,\\r\\nfortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one occasion he\\r\\nactually seized her in his arms and embraced her—an outrage which\\r\\ncaused his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘But why did you stand all this,’ I asked. ‘I suppose that you can get\\r\\nrid of your boarders when you wish.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. ‘Would to God that\\r\\nI had given him notice on the very day that he came,’ she said. ‘But it\\r\\nwas a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each—fourteen\\r\\npounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy\\r\\nin the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for\\r\\nthe best. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to\\r\\nleave on account of it. That was the reason of his going.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Well?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave\\r\\njust now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper\\r\\nis violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed\\r\\nthe door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in\\r\\nless than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr.\\r\\nDrebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the worse for\\r\\ndrink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my\\r\\ndaughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his\\r\\ntrain. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to\\r\\nher that she should fly with him. “You are of age,” he said, “and there\\r\\nis no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the\\r\\nold girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live\\r\\nlike a princess.” Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away\\r\\nfrom him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her\\r\\ntowards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came\\r\\ninto the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the\\r\\nconfused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head.\\r\\nWhen I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with\\r\\na stick in his hand. “I don’t think that fine fellow will trouble us\\r\\nagain,” he said. “I will just go after him and see what he does with\\r\\nhimself.” With those words he took his hat and started off down the\\r\\nstreet. The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber’s mysterious death.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier’s lips with many gasps and\\r\\npauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words.\\r\\nI made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there\\r\\nshould be no possibility of a mistake.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s quite exciting,” said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. “What\\r\\nhappened next?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When Mrs. Charpentier paused,” the detective continued, “I saw that\\r\\nthe whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way\\r\\nwhich I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her\\r\\nson returned.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I do not know,’ she answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Not know?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘After you went to bed?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘When did you go to bed?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘About eleven.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘So your son was gone at least two hours?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Possibly four or five?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘What was he doing during that time?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I do not know,’ she answered, turning white to her very lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found out\\r\\nwhere Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and\\r\\narrested him. When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come\\r\\nquietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass, ‘I suppose you are\\r\\narresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel\\r\\nDrebber,’ he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that his\\r\\nalluding to it had a most suspicious aspect.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as\\r\\nhaving with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is your theory, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton\\r\\nRoad. When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course\\r\\nof which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the\\r\\nstomach, perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night\\r\\nwas so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of\\r\\nhis victim into the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and\\r\\nthe writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks\\r\\nto throw the police on to the wrong scent.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well done!” said Holmes in an encouraging voice. “Really, Gregson, you\\r\\nare getting along. We shall make something of you yet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,” the detective\\r\\nanswered proudly. “The young man volunteered a statement, in which he\\r\\nsaid that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him,\\r\\nand took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an\\r\\nold shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this\\r\\nold shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. I\\r\\nthink the whole case fits together uncommonly well. What amuses me is\\r\\nto think of Lestrade, who had started off upon the wrong scent. I am\\r\\nafraid he won’t make much of it. Why, by Jove, here’s the very man\\r\\nhimself!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were\\r\\ntalking, and who now entered the room. The assurance and jauntiness\\r\\nwhich generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however, wanting.\\r\\nHis face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged\\r\\nand untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of consulting with\\r\\nSherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be\\r\\nembarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the room, fumbling\\r\\nnervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. “This is a most\\r\\nextraordinary case,” he said at last—“a most incomprehensible affair.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade!” cried Gregson, triumphantly. “I\\r\\nthought you would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find the\\r\\nSecretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson,” said Lestrade gravely, “was\\r\\nmurdered at Halliday’s Private Hotel about six o’clock this morning.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII.\\r\\nLIGHT IN THE DARKNESS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so\\r\\nunexpected, that we were all three fairly dumfoundered. Gregson sprang\\r\\nout of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. I\\r\\nstared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and\\r\\nhis brows drawn down over his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stangerson too!” he muttered. “The plot thickens.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was quite thick enough before,” grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair.\\r\\n“I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you—are you sure of this piece of intelligence?” stammered\\r\\nGregson.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have just come from his room,” said Lestrade. “I was the first to\\r\\ndiscover what had occurred.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have been hearing Gregson’s view of the matter,” Holmes observed.\\r\\n“Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have no objection,” Lestrade answered, seating himself. “I freely\\r\\nconfess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the\\r\\ndeath of Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was\\r\\ncompletely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out\\r\\nwhat had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston\\r\\nStation about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in\\r\\nthe morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question\\r\\nwhich confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed\\r\\nbetween 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him\\r\\nafterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the\\r\\nman, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then\\r\\nset to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the\\r\\nvicinity of Euston. You see, I argued that if Drebber and his companion\\r\\nhad become separated, the natural course for the latter would be to put\\r\\nup somewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the\\r\\nstation again next morning.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,”\\r\\nremarked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making\\r\\nenquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and\\r\\nat eight o’clock I reached Halliday’s Private Hotel, in Little George\\r\\nStreet. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there,\\r\\nthey at once answered me in the affirmative.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,’ they said. ‘He\\r\\nhas been waiting for a gentleman for two days.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Where is he now?’ I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I will go up and see him at once,’ I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and\\r\\nlead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me\\r\\nthe room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor\\r\\nleading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about\\r\\nto go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish,\\r\\nin spite of my twenty years’ experience. From under the door there\\r\\ncurled a little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the\\r\\npassage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side.\\r\\nI gave a cry, which brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he\\r\\nsaw it. The door was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to\\r\\nit, and knocked it in. The window of the room was open, and beside the\\r\\nwindow, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was\\r\\nquite dead, and had been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and\\r\\ncold. When we turned him over, the Boots recognized him at once as\\r\\nbeing the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of\\r\\nJoseph Stangerson. The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side,\\r\\nwhich must have penetrated the heart. And now comes the strangest part\\r\\nof the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror,\\r\\neven before Sherlock Holmes answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The word RACHE, written in letters of blood,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was it,” said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all\\r\\nsilent for a while.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the\\r\\ndeeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to\\r\\nhis crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle\\r\\ntingled as I thought of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The man was seen,” continued Lestrade. “A milk boy, passing on his way\\r\\nto the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews\\r\\nat the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay\\r\\nthere, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which\\r\\nwas wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the\\r\\nladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to\\r\\nbe some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular\\r\\nnotice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for\\r\\nhim to be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a\\r\\nreddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have\\r\\nstayed in the room some little time after the murder, for we found\\r\\nblood-stained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and\\r\\nmarks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which\\r\\ntallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of\\r\\nexultation or satisfaction upon his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the\\r\\nmurderer?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing. Stangerson had Drebber’s purse in his pocket, but it seems\\r\\nthat this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd\\r\\npounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these\\r\\nextraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. There were\\r\\nno papers or memoranda in the murdered man’s pocket, except a single\\r\\ntelegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the\\r\\nwords, ‘J. H. is in Europe.’ There was no name appended to this\\r\\nmessage.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And there was nothing else?” Holmes asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing of any importance. The man’s novel, with which he had read\\r\\nhimself to sleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair\\r\\nbeside him. There was a glass of water on the table, and on the\\r\\nwindow-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The last link,” he cried, exultantly. “My case is complete.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two detectives stared at him in amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have now in my hands,” my companion said, confidently, “all the\\r\\nthreads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, details\\r\\nto be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the\\r\\ntime that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to the\\r\\ndiscovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own\\r\\neyes. I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand\\r\\nupon those pills?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have them,” said Lestrade, producing a small white box; “I took them\\r\\nand the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place\\r\\nof safety at the Police Station. It was the merest chance my taking\\r\\nthese pills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance\\r\\nto them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give them here,” said Holmes. “Now, Doctor,” turning to me, “are those\\r\\nordinary pills?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small,\\r\\nround, and almost transparent against the light. “From their lightness\\r\\nand transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,” I\\r\\nremarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Precisely so,” answered Holmes. “Now would you mind going down and\\r\\nfetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so\\r\\nlong, and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain\\r\\nyesterday.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI went downstairs and carried the dog upstairs in my arms. Its laboured\\r\\nbreathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end.\\r\\nIndeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded\\r\\nthe usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the\\r\\nrug.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will now cut one of these pills in two,” said Holmes, and drawing\\r\\nhis penknife he suited the action to the word. “One half we return into\\r\\nthe box for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine\\r\\nglass, in which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our\\r\\nfriend, the Doctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This may be very interesting,” said Lestrade, in the injured tone of\\r\\none who suspects that he is being laughed at, “I cannot see, however,\\r\\nwhat it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Patience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has\\r\\neverything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the\\r\\nmixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps\\r\\nit up readily enough.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and\\r\\nplaced it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes’ earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in\\r\\nsilence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling\\r\\neffect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretched\\r\\nupon the cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently neither\\r\\nthe better nor the worse for its draught.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without\\r\\nresult, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared\\r\\nupon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the\\r\\ntable, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great was\\r\\nhis emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two\\r\\ndetectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check\\r\\nwhich he had met.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It can’t be a coincidence,” he cried, at last springing from his chair\\r\\nand pacing wildly up and down the room; “it is impossible that it\\r\\nshould be a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the\\r\\ncase of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson. And\\r\\nyet they are inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of\\r\\nreasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible! And yet this\\r\\nwretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it! I have it!” With a\\r\\nperfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, cut the other pill in\\r\\ntwo, dissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the terrier. The\\r\\nunfortunate creature’s tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in\\r\\nit before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid\\r\\nand lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his\\r\\nforehead. “I should have more faith,” he said; “I ought to know by this\\r\\ntime that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of\\r\\ndeductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other\\r\\ninterpretation. Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly\\r\\npoison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that\\r\\nbefore ever I saw the box at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could\\r\\nhardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog,\\r\\nhowever, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me\\r\\nthat the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began\\r\\nto have a dim, vague perception of the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All this seems strange to you,” continued Holmes, “because you failed\\r\\nat the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single\\r\\nreal clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize\\r\\nupon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to\\r\\nconfirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence\\r\\nof it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more\\r\\nobscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions.\\r\\nIt is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most\\r\\ncommonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no\\r\\nnew or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murder\\r\\nwould have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of\\r\\nthe victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those\\r\\n_outré_ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it\\r\\nremarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more\\r\\ndifficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable\\r\\nimpatience, could contain himself no longer. “Look here, Mr. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes,” he said, “we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart\\r\\nman, and that you have your own methods of working. We want something\\r\\nmore than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a case of taking\\r\\nthe man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. Young\\r\\nCharpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. Lestrade\\r\\nwent after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too.\\r\\nYou have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more\\r\\nthan we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to\\r\\nask you straight how much you do know of the business. Can you name the\\r\\nman who did it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,” remarked Lestrade.\\r\\n“We have both tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked more\\r\\nthan once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence\\r\\nwhich you require. Surely you will not withhold it any longer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Any delay in arresting the assassin,” I observed, “might give him time\\r\\nto perpetrate some fresh atrocity.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He\\r\\ncontinued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest\\r\\nand his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There will be no more murders,” he said at last, stopping abruptly and\\r\\nfacing us. “You can put that consideration out of the question. You\\r\\nhave asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere\\r\\nknowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the power\\r\\nof laying our hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do. I have\\r\\ngood hopes of managing it through my own arrangements; but it is a\\r\\nthing which needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate\\r\\nman to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by\\r\\nanother who is as clever as himself. As long as this man has no idea\\r\\nthat anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him; but\\r\\nif he had the slightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish\\r\\nin an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city.\\r\\nWithout meaning to hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that\\r\\nI consider these men to be more than a match for the official force,\\r\\nand that is why I have not asked your assistance. If I fail I shall, of\\r\\ncourse, incur all the blame due to this omission; but that I am\\r\\nprepared for. At present I am ready to promise that the instant that I\\r\\ncan communicate with you without endangering my own combinations, I\\r\\nshall do so.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance,\\r\\nor by the depreciating allusion to the detective police. The former had\\r\\nflushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the other’s beady\\r\\neyes glistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither of them had time\\r\\nto speak, however, before there was a tap at the door, and the\\r\\nspokesman of the street Arabs, young Wiggins, introduced his\\r\\ninsignificant and unsavoury person.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Please, sir,” he said, touching his forelock, “I have the cab\\r\\ndownstairs.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good boy,” said Holmes, blandly. “Why don’t you introduce this pattern\\r\\nat Scotland Yard?” he continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs from\\r\\na drawer. “See how beautifully the spring works. They fasten in an\\r\\ninstant.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The old pattern is good enough,” remarked Lestrade, “if we can only\\r\\nfind the man to put them on.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very good, very good,” said Holmes, smiling. “The cabman may as well\\r\\nhelp me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about\\r\\nto set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it.\\r\\nThere was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out and\\r\\nbegan to strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,” he said, kneeling over\\r\\nhis task, and never turning his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put\\r\\ndown his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click, the\\r\\njangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gentlemen,” he cried, with flashing eyes, “let me introduce you to Mr.\\r\\nJefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph\\r\\nStangerson.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole thing occurred in a moment—so quickly that I had no time to\\r\\nrealize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes’\\r\\ntriumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman’s dazed,\\r\\nsavage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had\\r\\nappeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a second or two we might\\r\\nhave been a group of statues. Then, with an inarticulate roar of fury,\\r\\nthe prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes’s grasp, and hurled\\r\\nhimself through the window. Woodwork and glass gave way before him; but\\r\\nbefore he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon\\r\\nhim like so many staghounds. He was dragged back into the room, and\\r\\nthen commenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he,\\r\\nthat the four of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to\\r\\nhave the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. His face and\\r\\nhands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass, but loss\\r\\nof blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. It was not until\\r\\nLestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and\\r\\nhalf-strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of\\r\\nno avail; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his\\r\\nfeet as well as his hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless\\r\\nand panting.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have his cab,” said Sherlock Holmes. “It will serve to take him to\\r\\nScotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,” he continued, with a pleasant\\r\\nsmile, “we have reached the end of our little mystery. You are very\\r\\nwelcome to put any questions that you like to me now, and there is no\\r\\ndanger that I will refuse to answer them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART II.\\r\\n_The Country of the Saints._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I.\\r\\nON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies\\r\\nan arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a\\r\\nbarrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to\\r\\nNebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado\\r\\nupon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature\\r\\nalways in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises\\r\\nsnow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are\\r\\nswift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged cañons; and there are\\r\\nenormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are\\r\\ngrey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the\\r\\ncommon characteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees or\\r\\nof Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other\\r\\nhunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight\\r\\nof those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their\\r\\nprairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily\\r\\nthrough the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark\\r\\nravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks.\\r\\nThese are the sole dwellers in the wilderness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the\\r\\nnorthern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach\\r\\nstretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of\\r\\nalkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On\\r\\nthe extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks,\\r\\nwith their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch of\\r\\ncountry there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life.\\r\\nThere is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull,\\r\\ngrey earth—above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may,\\r\\nthere is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing\\r\\nbut silence—complete and heart-subduing silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad\\r\\nplain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one\\r\\nsees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is\\r\\nlost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down\\r\\nby the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered\\r\\nwhite objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull\\r\\ndeposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones: some\\r\\nlarge and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have\\r\\nbelonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one\\r\\nmay trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of\\r\\nthose who had fallen by the wayside.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May,\\r\\neighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance\\r\\nwas such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the\\r\\nregion. An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was\\r\\nnearer to forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the\\r\\nbrown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones;\\r\\nhis long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white;\\r\\nhis eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre;\\r\\nwhile the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that\\r\\nof a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and\\r\\nyet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a\\r\\nwiry and vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his\\r\\nclothes, which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed\\r\\nwhat it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man\\r\\nwas dying—dying from hunger and from thirst.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little\\r\\nelevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the\\r\\ngreat salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of\\r\\nsavage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might\\r\\nindicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there\\r\\nwas no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild\\r\\nquestioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come to\\r\\nan end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. “Why\\r\\nnot here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,” he\\r\\nmuttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless\\r\\nrifle, and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had\\r\\ncarried slung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too\\r\\nheavy for his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground\\r\\nwith some little violence. Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a\\r\\nlittle moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face,\\r\\nwith very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ve hurt me!” said a childish voice reproachfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have I though,” the man answered penitently, “I didn’t go for to do\\r\\nit.” As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty\\r\\nlittle girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart\\r\\npink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother’s care. The\\r\\nchild was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she\\r\\nhad suffered less than her companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How is it now?” he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the\\r\\ntowsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kiss it and make it well,” she said, with perfect gravity, showing the\\r\\ninjured part up to him. “That’s what mother used to do. Where’s\\r\\nmother?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mother’s gone. I guess you’ll see her before long.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gone, eh!” said the little girl. “Funny, she didn’t say good-bye; she\\r\\n‘most always did if she was just goin’ over to Auntie’s for tea, and\\r\\nnow she’s been away three days. Say, it’s awful dry, ain’t it? Ain’t\\r\\nthere no water, nor nothing to eat?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, there ain’t nothing, dearie. You’ll just need to be patient\\r\\nawhile, and then you’ll be all right. Put your head up agin me like\\r\\nthat, and then you’ll feel bullier. It ain’t easy to talk when your\\r\\nlips is like leather, but I guess I’d best let you know how the cards\\r\\nlie. What’s that you’ve got?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pretty things! fine things!” cried the little girl enthusiastically,\\r\\nholding up two glittering fragments of mica. “When we goes back to home\\r\\nI’ll give them to brother Bob.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll see prettier things than them soon,” said the man confidently.\\r\\n“You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you though—you remember when\\r\\nwe left the river?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, we reckoned we’d strike another river soon, d’ye see. But there\\r\\nwas somethin’ wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin’, and it didn’t\\r\\nturn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of you\\r\\nand—and——”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you couldn’t wash yourself,” interrupted his companion gravely,\\r\\nstaring up at his grimy visage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian\\r\\nPete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie,\\r\\nyour mother.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then mother’s a deader too,” cried the little girl dropping her face\\r\\nin her pinafore and sobbing bitterly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some\\r\\nchance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and\\r\\nwe tramped it together. It don’t seem as though we’ve improved matters.\\r\\nThere’s an almighty small chance for us now!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you mean that we are going to die too?” asked the child, checking\\r\\nher sobs, and raising her tear-stained face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I guess that’s about the size of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why didn’t you say so before?” she said, laughing gleefully. “You gave\\r\\nme such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we’ll be with\\r\\nmother again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, you will, dearie.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you too. I’ll tell her how awful good you’ve been. I’ll bet she\\r\\nmeets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot\\r\\nof buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was\\r\\nfond of. How long will it be first?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know—not very long.” The man’s eyes were fixed upon the\\r\\nnorthern horizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared\\r\\nthree little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly\\r\\ndid they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large\\r\\nbrown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and\\r\\nthen settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards,\\r\\nthe vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Cocks and hens,” cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their\\r\\nill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. “Say, did\\r\\nGod make this country?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In course He did,” said her companion, rather startled by this\\r\\nunexpected question.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,” the\\r\\nlittle girl continued. “I guess somebody else made the country in these\\r\\nparts. It’s not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the\\r\\ntrees.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What would ye think of offering up prayer?” the man asked diffidently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It ain’t night yet,” she answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It don’t matter. It ain’t quite regular, but He won’t mind that, you\\r\\nbet. You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the\\r\\nwaggon when we was on the Plains.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why don’t you say some yourself?” the child asked, with wondering\\r\\neyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I disremember them,” he answered. “I hain’t said none since I was half\\r\\nthe height o’ that gun. I guess it’s never too late. You say them out,\\r\\nand I’ll stand by and come in on the choruses.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you’ll need to kneel down, and me too,” she said, laying the\\r\\nshawl out for that purpose. “You’ve got to put your hands up like this.\\r\\nIt makes you feel kind o’ good.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see\\r\\nit. Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the\\r\\nlittle prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her\\r\\nchubby face, and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the\\r\\ncloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom\\r\\nthey were face to face, while the two voices—the one thin and clear,\\r\\nthe other deep and harsh—united in the entreaty for mercy and\\r\\nforgiveness. The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow\\r\\nof the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad\\r\\nbreast of her protector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but\\r\\nNature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights\\r\\nhe had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids\\r\\ndrooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the\\r\\nbreast, until the man’s grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses\\r\\nof his companion, and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight\\r\\nwould have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali\\r\\nplain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and\\r\\nhardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but\\r\\ngradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid,\\r\\nwell-defined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it\\r\\nbecame evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of\\r\\nmoving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come to\\r\\nthe conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon\\r\\nthe prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously impossible in\\r\\nthese arid wilds. As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary\\r\\nbluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered\\r\\ntilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up\\r\\nthrough the haze, and the apparition revealed itself as being a great\\r\\ncaravan upon its journey for the West. But what a caravan! When the\\r\\nhead of it had reached the base of the mountains, the rear was not yet\\r\\nvisible on the horizon. Right across the enormous plain stretched the\\r\\nstraggling array, waggons and carts, men on horseback, and men on foot.\\r\\nInnumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who\\r\\ntoddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white\\r\\ncoverings. This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but\\r\\nrather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of\\r\\ncircumstances to seek themselves a new country. There rose through the\\r\\nclear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of\\r\\nhumanity, with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses. Loud\\r\\nas it was, it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced\\r\\nmen, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On\\r\\nreaching the base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council\\r\\namong themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The wells are to the right, my brothers,” said one, a hard-lipped,\\r\\nclean-shaven man with grizzly hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To the right of the Sierra Blanco—so we shall reach the Rio Grande,”\\r\\nsaid another.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fear not for water,” cried a third. “He who could draw it from the\\r\\nrocks will not now abandon His own chosen people.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Amen! Amen!” responded the whole party.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and\\r\\nkeenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag\\r\\nabove them. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink,\\r\\nshowing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight\\r\\nthere was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while\\r\\nfresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word\\r\\n‘Redskins’ was on every lip.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There can’t be any number of Injuns here,” said the elderly man who\\r\\nappeared to be in command. “We have passed the Pawnees, and there are\\r\\nno other tribes until we cross the great mountains.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,” asked one of the\\r\\nband.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And I,” “and I,” cried a dozen voices.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Leave your horses below and we will await you here,” the Elder\\r\\nanswered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their\\r\\nhorses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the\\r\\nobject which had excited their curiosity. They advanced rapidly and\\r\\nnoiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts. The\\r\\nwatchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock\\r\\nuntil their figures stood out against the skyline. The young man who\\r\\nhad first given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his followers saw\\r\\nhim throw up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and on\\r\\njoining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met\\r\\ntheir eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a\\r\\nsingle giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man,\\r\\nlong-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. His\\r\\nplacid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep.\\r\\nBeside him lay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his\\r\\nbrown sinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast\\r\\nof his velveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular\\r\\nline of snow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played over her\\r\\ninfantile features. Her plump little white legs terminating in white\\r\\nsocks and neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast\\r\\nto the long shrivelled members of her companion. On the ledge of rock\\r\\nabove this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at\\r\\nthe sight of the new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment\\r\\nand flapped sullenly away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about\\r\\nthem in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down\\r\\nupon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him,\\r\\nand which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts.\\r\\nHis face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he\\r\\npassed his boney hand over his eyes. “This is what they call delirium,\\r\\nI guess,” he muttered. The child stood beside him, holding on to the\\r\\nskirt of his coat, and said nothing but looked all round her with the\\r\\nwondering questioning gaze of childhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways\\r\\nthat their appearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little\\r\\ngirl, and hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her\\r\\ngaunt companion, and assisted him towards the waggons.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My name is John Ferrier,” the wanderer explained; “me and that little\\r\\nun are all that’s left o’ twenty-one people. The rest is all dead o’\\r\\nthirst and hunger away down in the south.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is she your child?” asked someone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I guess she is now,” the other cried, defiantly; “she’s mine ‘cause I\\r\\nsaved her. No man will take her from me. She’s Lucy Ferrier from this\\r\\nday on. Who are you, though?” he continued, glancing with curiosity at\\r\\nhis stalwart, sunburned rescuers; “there seems to be a powerful lot of\\r\\nye.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nigh upon ten thousand,” said one of the young men; “we are the\\r\\npersecuted children of God—the chosen of the Angel Merona.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I never heard tell on him,” said the wanderer. “He appears to have\\r\\nchosen a fair crowd of ye.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do not jest at that which is sacred,” said the other sternly. “We are\\r\\nof those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian\\r\\nletters on plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy\\r\\nJoseph Smith at Palmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of\\r\\nIllinois, where we had founded our temple. We have come to seek a\\r\\nrefuge from the violent man and from the godless, even though it be the\\r\\nheart of the desert.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier. “I\\r\\nsee,” he said, “you are the Mormons.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are the Mormons,” answered his companions with one voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And where are you going?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of our\\r\\nProphet. You must come before him. He shall say what is to be done with\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surrounded\\r\\nby crowds of the pilgrims—pale-faced meek-looking women, strong\\r\\nlaughing children, and anxious earnest-eyed men. Many were the cries of\\r\\nastonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they\\r\\nperceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the\\r\\nother. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by a\\r\\ngreat crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was\\r\\nconspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of\\r\\nits appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were\\r\\nfurnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the driver there\\r\\nsat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but\\r\\nwhose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader. He\\r\\nwas reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laid\\r\\nit aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode. Then\\r\\nhe turned to the two castaways.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If we take you with us,” he said, in solemn words, “it can only be as\\r\\nbelievers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better\\r\\nfar that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you\\r\\nshould prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts\\r\\nthe whole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Guess I’ll come with you on any terms,” said Ferrier, with such\\r\\nemphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader\\r\\nalone retained his stern, impressive expression.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Take him, Brother Stangerson,” he said, “give him food and drink, and\\r\\nthe child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy\\r\\ncreed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“On, on to Zion!” cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled\\r\\ndown the long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away\\r\\nin a dull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a\\r\\ncreaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon the\\r\\nwhole caravan was winding along once more. The Elder to whose care the\\r\\ntwo waifs had been committed, led them to his waggon, where a meal was\\r\\nalready awaiting them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You shall remain here,” he said. “In a few days you will have\\r\\nrecovered from your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and\\r\\nfor ever you are of our religion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has\\r\\nspoken with the voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II.\\r\\nTHE FLOWER OF UTAH.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured\\r\\nby the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From\\r\\nthe shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky\\r\\nMountains they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in\\r\\nhistory. The savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue,\\r\\nand disease—every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had\\r\\nall been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and\\r\\nthe accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among\\r\\nthem. There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt\\r\\nprayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight\\r\\nbeneath them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was\\r\\nthe promised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for\\r\\nevermore.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as\\r\\na resolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the\\r\\nfuture city was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and\\r\\nallotted in proportion to the standing of each individual. The\\r\\ntradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the\\r\\ntown streets and squares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country\\r\\nthere was draining and hedging, planting and clearing, until the next\\r\\nsummer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop. Everything\\r\\nprospered in the strange settlement. Above all, the great temple which\\r\\nthey had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger.\\r\\nFrom the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight, the\\r\\nclatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the\\r\\nmonument which the immigrants erected to Him who had led them safe\\r\\nthrough many dangers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his\\r\\nfortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons\\r\\nto the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne\\r\\nalong pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson’s waggon, a retreat which\\r\\nshe shared with the Mormon’s three wives and with his son, a headstrong\\r\\nforward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of\\r\\nchildhood, from the shock caused by her mother’s death, she soon became\\r\\na pet with the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her\\r\\nmoving canvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered\\r\\nfrom his privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an\\r\\nindefatigable hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new\\r\\ncompanions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was\\r\\nunanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as\\r\\nfertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of\\r\\nYoung himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who\\r\\nwere the four principal Elders.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial\\r\\nlog-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it\\r\\ngrew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen\\r\\nin his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution\\r\\nenabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his\\r\\nlands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him\\r\\nprospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his\\r\\nneighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in\\r\\ntwelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City\\r\\nwho could compare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant\\r\\nWahsatch Mountains there was no name better known than that of John\\r\\nFerrier.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was one way and only one in which he offended the\\r\\nsusceptibilities of his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion\\r\\ncould ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner\\r\\nof his companions. He never gave reasons for this persistent refusal,\\r\\nbut contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his\\r\\ndetermination. There were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his\\r\\nadopted religion, and others who put it down to greed of wealth and\\r\\nreluctance to incur expense. Others, again, spoke of some early love\\r\\naffair, and of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on the shores of\\r\\nthe Atlantic. Whatever the reason, Ferrier remained strictly celibate.\\r\\nIn every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young\\r\\nsettlement, and gained the name of being an orthodox and\\r\\nstraight-walking man.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted\\r\\nfather in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the\\r\\nbalsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to\\r\\nthe young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger,\\r\\nher cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon\\r\\nthe high road which ran by Ferrier’s farm felt long-forgotten thoughts\\r\\nrevive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping\\r\\nthrough the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father’s mustang,\\r\\nand managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the\\r\\nWest. So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her\\r\\nfather the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of\\r\\nAmerican girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had\\r\\ndeveloped into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious\\r\\nchange is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of\\r\\nall does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the\\r\\ntouch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns,\\r\\nwith a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has\\r\\nawoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and\\r\\nremember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life.\\r\\nIn the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself,\\r\\napart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many\\r\\nbesides.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as\\r\\nthe bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields\\r\\nand in the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty\\r\\nhigh roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to\\r\\nthe west, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the\\r\\nOverland Route lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were\\r\\ndroves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands,\\r\\nand trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their\\r\\ninterminable journey. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her\\r\\nway with the skill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy\\r\\nFerrier, her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut\\r\\nhair floating out behind her. She had a commission from her father in\\r\\nthe City, and was dashing in as she had done many a time before, with\\r\\nall the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was\\r\\nto be performed. The travel-stained adventurers gazed after her in\\r\\nastonishment, and even the unemotional Indians, journeying in with\\r\\ntheir pelties, relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at\\r\\nthe beauty of the pale-faced maiden.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road\\r\\nblocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking\\r\\nherdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass\\r\\nthis obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap.\\r\\nScarcely had she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed\\r\\nin behind her, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving\\r\\nstream of fierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to\\r\\ndeal with cattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took\\r\\nadvantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of\\r\\npushing her way through the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one\\r\\nof the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact\\r\\nwith the flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant\\r\\nit reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and\\r\\ntossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider.\\r\\nThe situation was full of peril. Every plunge of the excited horse\\r\\nbrought it against the horns again, and goaded it to fresh madness. It\\r\\nwas all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle, yet a\\r\\nslip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and\\r\\nterrified animals. Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her head began\\r\\nto swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax. Choked by the rising\\r\\ncloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she might\\r\\nhave abandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice at her\\r\\nelbow which assured her of assistance. At the same moment a sinewy\\r\\nbrown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way\\r\\nthrough the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re not hurt, I hope, miss,” said her preserver, respectfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. “I’m awful\\r\\nfrightened,” she said, naively; “whoever would have thought that Poncho\\r\\nwould have been so scared by a lot of cows?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank God you kept your seat,” the other said earnestly. He was a\\r\\ntall, savage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse,\\r\\nand clad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over\\r\\nhis shoulders. “I guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,” he\\r\\nremarked, “I saw you ride down from his house. When you see him, ask\\r\\nhim if he remembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis. If he’s the same\\r\\nFerrier, my father and he were pretty thick.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hadn’t you better come and ask yourself?” she asked, demurely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes\\r\\nsparkled with pleasure. “I’ll do so,” he said, “we’ve been in the\\r\\nmountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting\\r\\ncondition. He must take us as he finds us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,” she answered,\\r\\n“he’s awful fond of me. If those cows had jumped on me he’d have never\\r\\ngot over it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Neither would I,” said her companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You! Well, I don’t see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow.\\r\\nYou ain’t even a friend of ours.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young hunter’s dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy\\r\\nFerrier laughed aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There, I didn’t mean that,” she said; “of course, you are a friend\\r\\nnow. You must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won’t\\r\\ntrust me with his business any more. Good-bye!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-bye,” he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over\\r\\nher little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her\\r\\nriding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of\\r\\ndust.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn.\\r\\nHe and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver,\\r\\nand were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital\\r\\nenough to work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as\\r\\nkeen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had\\r\\ndrawn his thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young\\r\\ngirl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his\\r\\nvolcanic, untamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished from\\r\\nhis sight, he realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that\\r\\nneither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of\\r\\nsuch importance to him as this new and all-absorbing one. The love\\r\\nwhich had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy\\r\\nof a boy, but rather the wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will\\r\\nand imperious temper. He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he\\r\\nundertook. He swore in his heart that he would not fail in this if\\r\\nhuman effort and human perseverance could render him successful.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until his\\r\\nface was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the\\r\\nvalley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning the\\r\\nnews of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this\\r\\nJefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested\\r\\nLucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and\\r\\ncould narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in\\r\\nthose wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a\\r\\nsilver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to\\r\\nbe had, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became\\r\\na favourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues.\\r\\nOn such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her\\r\\nbright, happy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no\\r\\nlonger her own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms,\\r\\nbut they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her\\r\\naffections.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled\\r\\nup at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He\\r\\nthrew the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am off, Lucy,” he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing\\r\\ntenderly down into her face; “I won’t ask you to come with me now, but\\r\\nwill you be ready to come when I am here again?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And when will that be?” she asked, blushing and laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then, my\\r\\ndarling. There’s no one who can stand between us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how about father?” she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has given his consent, provided we get these mines working all\\r\\nright. I have no fear on that head.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there’s\\r\\nno more to be said,” she whispered, with her cheek against his broad\\r\\nbreast.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank God!” he said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her. “It is\\r\\nsettled, then. The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They are\\r\\nwaiting for me at the cañon. Good-bye, my own darling—good-bye. In two\\r\\nmonths you shall see me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his\\r\\nhorse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though\\r\\nafraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what\\r\\nhe was leaving. She stood at the gate, gazing after him until he\\r\\nvanished from her sight. Then she walked back into the house, the\\r\\nhappiest girl in all Utah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III.\\r\\nJOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThree weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had\\r\\ndeparted from Salt Lake City. John Ferrier’s heart was sore within him\\r\\nwhen he thought of the young man’s return, and of the impending loss of\\r\\nhis adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the\\r\\narrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always\\r\\ndetermined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever\\r\\ninduce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he\\r\\nregarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever\\r\\nhe might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was\\r\\ninflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to\\r\\nexpress an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in\\r\\nthe Land of the Saints.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, a dangerous matter—so dangerous that even the most saintly dared\\r\\nonly whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something\\r\\nwhich fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a\\r\\nswift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turned\\r\\npersecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most terrible\\r\\ndescription. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German\\r\\nVehmgericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put\\r\\na more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over\\r\\nthe State of Utah.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this\\r\\norganization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and\\r\\nomnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out\\r\\nagainst the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or\\r\\nwhat had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home,\\r\\nbut no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands\\r\\nof his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed by\\r\\nannihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this\\r\\nterrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men went\\r\\nabout in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the\\r\\nwilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the\\r\\nrecalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards\\r\\nto pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The\\r\\nsupply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female\\r\\npopulation on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange\\r\\nrumours began to be bandied about—rumours of murdered immigrants and\\r\\nrifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women\\r\\nappeared in the harems of the Elders—women who pined and wept, and bore\\r\\nupon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated\\r\\nwanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked,\\r\\nstealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. These\\r\\ntales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and\\r\\nre-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name.\\r\\nTo this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite\\r\\nBand, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one.\\r\\n\\r\\nFuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible\\r\\nresults served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it\\r\\ninspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless\\r\\nsociety. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and\\r\\nviolence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret.\\r\\nThe very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the\\r\\nProphet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth at\\r\\nnight with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence every\\r\\nman feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were\\r\\nnearest his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields,\\r\\nwhen he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window,\\r\\nsaw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His\\r\\nheart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great\\r\\nBrigham Young himself. Full of trepidation—for he knew that such a\\r\\nvisit boded him little good—Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon\\r\\nchief. The latter, however, received his salutations coldly, and\\r\\nfollowed him with a stern face into the sitting-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Brother Ferrier,” he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly\\r\\nfrom under his light-coloured eyelashes, “the true believers have been\\r\\ngood friends to you. We picked you up when you were starving in the\\r\\ndesert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley,\\r\\ngave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our\\r\\nprotection. Is not this so?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is so,” answered John Ferrier.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you\\r\\nshould embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages.\\r\\nThis you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you\\r\\nhave neglected.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how have I neglected it?” asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in\\r\\nexpostulation. “Have I not given to the common fund? Have I not\\r\\nattended at the Temple? Have I not——?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where are your wives?” asked Young, looking round him. “Call them in,\\r\\nthat I may greet them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is true that I have not married,” Ferrier answered. “But women were\\r\\nfew, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a\\r\\nlonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is of that daughter that I would speak to you,” said the leader of\\r\\nthe Mormons. “She has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found\\r\\nfavour in the eyes of many who are high in the land.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Ferrier groaned internally.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve—stories that\\r\\nshe is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues.\\r\\nWhat is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith?\\r\\n‘Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for if she\\r\\nwed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.’ This being so, it is\\r\\nimpossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your\\r\\ndaughter to violate it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his\\r\\nriding-whip.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested—so it has been\\r\\ndecided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would\\r\\nnot have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all\\r\\nchoice. We Elders have many heifers,[1] but our children must also be\\r\\nprovided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of\\r\\nthem would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choose\\r\\nbetween them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say\\r\\nyou to that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n    [1] Heber C. Kemball, in one of his sermons, alludes to his hundred\\r\\n    wives under this endearing epithet.\\r\\n\\r\\nFerrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will give us time,” he said at last. “My daughter is very\\r\\nyoung—she is scarce of an age to marry.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She shall have a month to choose,” said Young, rising from his seat.\\r\\n“At the end of that time she shall give her answer.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face and\\r\\nflashing eyes. “It were better for you, John Ferrier,” he thundered,\\r\\n“that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra\\r\\nBlanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of\\r\\nthe Holy Four!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and\\r\\nFerrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he\\r\\nshould broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon\\r\\nhis, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her\\r\\npale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I could not help it,” she said, in answer to his look. “His voice rang\\r\\nthrough the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you scare yourself,” he answered, drawing her to him, and\\r\\npassing his broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair.\\r\\n“We’ll fix it up somehow or another. You don’t find your fancy kind o’\\r\\nlessening for this chap, do you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nA sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No; of course not. I shouldn’t care to hear you say you did. He’s a\\r\\nlikely lad, and he’s a Christian, which is more than these folk here,\\r\\nin spite o’ all their praying and preaching. There’s a party starting\\r\\nfor Nevada to-morrow, and I’ll manage to send him a message letting him\\r\\nknow the hole we are in. If I know anything o’ that young man, he’ll be\\r\\nback here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy laughed through her tears at her father’s description.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you that\\r\\nI am frightened, dear. One hears—one hears such dreadful stories about\\r\\nthose who oppose the Prophet: something terrible always happens to\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But we haven’t opposed him yet,” her father answered. “It will be time\\r\\nto look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us; at\\r\\nthe end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Leave Utah!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s about the size of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the farm?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell\\r\\nthe truth, Lucy, it isn’t the first time I have thought of doing it. I\\r\\ndon’t care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their\\r\\ndarned prophet. I’m a free-born American, and it’s all new to me. Guess\\r\\nI’m too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this farm, he might\\r\\nchance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the\\r\\nopposite direction.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But they won’t let us leave,” his daughter objected.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait till Jefferson comes, and we’ll soon manage that. In the\\r\\nmeantime, don’t you fret yourself, my dearie, and don’t get your eyes\\r\\nswelled up, else he’ll be walking into me when he sees you. There’s\\r\\nnothing to be afeared about, and there’s no danger at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone,\\r\\nbut she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the\\r\\nfastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and\\r\\nloaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV.\\r\\nA FLIGHT FOR LIFE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet,\\r\\nJohn Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his\\r\\nacquaintance, who was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted him\\r\\nwith his message to Jefferson Hope. In it he told the young man of the\\r\\nimminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he\\r\\nshould return. Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and\\r\\nreturned home with a lighter heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to\\r\\neach of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on entering\\r\\nto find two young men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with a\\r\\nlong pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet\\r\\ncocked up upon the stove. The other, a bull-necked youth with coarse\\r\\nbloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands in\\r\\nhis pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both of them nodded to Ferrier as\\r\\nhe entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the\\r\\nconversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Maybe you don’t know us,” he said. “This here is the son of Elder\\r\\nDrebber, and I’m Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the\\r\\ndesert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the\\r\\ntrue fold.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As He will all the nations in His own good time,” said the other in a\\r\\nnasal voice; “He grindeth slowly but exceeding small.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have come,” continued Stangerson, “at the advice of our fathers to\\r\\nsolicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to\\r\\nyou and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has\\r\\nseven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay, nay, Brother Stangerson,” cried the other; “the question is not\\r\\nhow many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now\\r\\ngiven over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But my prospects are better,” said the other, warmly. “When the Lord\\r\\nremoves my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather\\r\\nfactory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It will be for the maiden to decide,” rejoined young Drebber, smirking\\r\\nat his own reflection in the glass. “We will leave it all to her\\r\\ndecision.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway,\\r\\nhardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look here,” he said at last, striding up to them, “when my daughter\\r\\nsummons you, you can come, but until then I don’t want to see your\\r\\nfaces again.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this\\r\\ncompetition between them for the maiden’s hand was the highest of\\r\\nhonours both to her and her father.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are two ways out of the room,” cried Ferrier; “there is the\\r\\ndoor, and there is the window. Which do you care to use?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening,\\r\\nthat his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. The\\r\\nold farmer followed them to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me know when you have settled which it is to be,” he said,\\r\\nsardonically.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You shall smart for this!” Stangerson cried, white with rage. “You\\r\\nhave defied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to\\r\\nthe end of your days.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,” cried young Drebber;\\r\\n“He will arise and smite you!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I’ll start the smiting,” exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would\\r\\nhave rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and\\r\\nrestrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses’\\r\\nhoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The young canting rascals!” he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from\\r\\nhis forehead; “I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the\\r\\nwife of either of them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And so should I, father,” she answered, with spirit; “but Jefferson\\r\\nwill soon be here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for\\r\\nwe do not know what their next move may be.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and\\r\\nhelp should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted\\r\\ndaughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been\\r\\nsuch a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If\\r\\nminor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this\\r\\narch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no\\r\\navail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been\\r\\nspirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He\\r\\nwas a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which\\r\\nhung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but this\\r\\nsuspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter,\\r\\nhowever, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she,\\r\\nwith the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from\\r\\nYoung as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an\\r\\nunlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his\\r\\nsurprise, a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed\\r\\njust over his chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:—\\r\\n\\r\\n“Twenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then——”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How\\r\\nthis warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his\\r\\nservants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been\\r\\nsecured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but\\r\\nthe incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days were\\r\\nevidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. What\\r\\nstrength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such\\r\\nmysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck\\r\\nhim to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their\\r\\nbreakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the\\r\\ncentre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the\\r\\nnumber 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not\\r\\nenlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and\\r\\nward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27\\r\\nhad been painted upon the outside of his door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his\\r\\nunseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some\\r\\nconspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the\\r\\nmonth of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls,\\r\\nsometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards\\r\\nstuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John\\r\\nFerrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A\\r\\nhorror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of\\r\\nthem. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled\\r\\nlook of some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that\\r\\nwas for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news\\r\\nof the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there\\r\\ncame no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a\\r\\ndriver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking\\r\\nthat help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to\\r\\nfour and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of\\r\\nescape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains\\r\\nwhich surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The\\r\\nmore-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could\\r\\npass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he\\r\\nwould, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him.\\r\\nYet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life\\r\\nitself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter’s\\r\\ndishonour.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles,\\r\\nand searching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown\\r\\nthe figure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the\\r\\nlast of the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague\\r\\nand terrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter—what was\\r\\nto become of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the\\r\\ninvisible network which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon\\r\\nthe table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound—low,\\r\\nbut very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of\\r\\nthe house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was\\r\\na pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was\\r\\nrepeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the\\r\\npanels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry\\r\\nout the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent\\r\\nwho was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier\\r\\nfelt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook\\r\\nhis nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt\\r\\nand threw the door open.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were\\r\\ntwinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the\\r\\nfarmer’s eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on\\r\\nthe road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier\\r\\nlooked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at\\r\\nhis own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face\\r\\nupon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with\\r\\nhis hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first\\r\\nthought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying\\r\\nman, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into\\r\\nthe hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within\\r\\nthe house the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to\\r\\nthe astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of\\r\\nJefferson Hope.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good God!” gasped John Ferrier. “How you scared me! Whatever made you\\r\\ncome in like that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give me food,” the other said, hoarsely. “I have had no time for bite\\r\\nor sup for eight-and-forty hours.” He flung himself upon the cold meat\\r\\nand bread which were still lying upon the table from his host’s supper,\\r\\nand devoured it voraciously. “Does Lucy bear up well?” he asked, when\\r\\nhe had satisfied his hunger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. She does not know the danger,” her father answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I\\r\\ncrawled my way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they’re not\\r\\nquite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a\\r\\ndevoted ally. He seized the young man’s leathery hand and wrung it\\r\\ncordially. “You’re a man to be proud of,” he said. “There are not many\\r\\nwho would come to share our danger and our troubles.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ve hit it there, pard,” the young hunter answered. “I have a\\r\\nrespect for you, but if you were alone in this business I’d think twice\\r\\nbefore I put my head into such a hornet’s nest. It’s Lucy that brings\\r\\nme here, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o’\\r\\nthe Hope family in Utah.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are we to do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost.\\r\\nI have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much\\r\\nmoney have you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for\\r\\nCarson City through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as\\r\\nwell that the servants do not sleep in the house.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching\\r\\njourney, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into\\r\\na small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by\\r\\nexperience that the mountain wells were few and far between. He had\\r\\nhardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his\\r\\ndaughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between the\\r\\nlovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was\\r\\nmuch to be done.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We must make our start at once,” said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a\\r\\nlow but resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the\\r\\nperil, but has steeled his heart to meet it. “The front and back\\r\\nentrances are watched, but with caution we may get away through the\\r\\nside window and across the fields. Once on the road we are only two\\r\\nmiles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we\\r\\nshould be half-way through the mountains.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What if we are stopped,” asked Ferrier.\\r\\n\\r\\nHope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his\\r\\ntunic. “If they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them\\r\\nwith us,” he said with a sinister smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the\\r\\ndarkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own,\\r\\nand which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved\\r\\nhimself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and\\r\\nhappiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes.\\r\\nAll looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad\\r\\nsilent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that the\\r\\nspirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set\\r\\nexpression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house\\r\\nhe had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.\\r\\n\\r\\nFerrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the\\r\\nscanty provisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a\\r\\nfew of her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and\\r\\ncarefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the\\r\\nnight, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. With\\r\\nbated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained\\r\\nthe shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap\\r\\nwhich opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when\\r\\nthe young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the\\r\\nshadow, where they lay silent and trembling.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the\\r\\nears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the\\r\\nmelancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of\\r\\nthem, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small\\r\\ndistance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the\\r\\ngap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal\\r\\ncry again, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To-morrow at midnight,” said the first who appeared to be in\\r\\nauthority. “When the Whip-poor-Will calls three times.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is well,” returned the other. “Shall I tell Brother Drebber?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Seven to five!” repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away\\r\\nin different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some\\r\\nform of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died\\r\\naway in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping\\r\\nhis companions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the\\r\\ntop of his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her\\r\\nstrength appeared to fail her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hurry on! hurry on!” he gasped from time to time. “We are through the\\r\\nline of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!”\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they meet\\r\\nanyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid\\r\\nrecognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a\\r\\nrugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged\\r\\npeaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led\\r\\nbetween them was the Eagle Cañon in which the horses were awaiting\\r\\nthem. With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the\\r\\ngreat boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he\\r\\ncame to the retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful\\r\\nanimals had been picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old\\r\\nFerrier upon one of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson\\r\\nHope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face\\r\\nNature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a\\r\\nthousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic\\r\\ncolumns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified\\r\\nmonster. On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all\\r\\nadvance impossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow\\r\\nin places that they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that\\r\\nonly practised riders could have traversed it at all. Yet in spite of\\r\\nall dangers and difficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light\\r\\nwithin them, for every step increased the distance between them and the\\r\\nterrible despotism from which they were flying.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the\\r\\njurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most\\r\\ndesolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and\\r\\npointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark\\r\\nand plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them\\r\\nas soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of “Who goes\\r\\nthere?” rang through the silent ravine.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Travellers for Nevada,” said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the\\r\\nrifle which hung by his saddle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down\\r\\nat them as if dissatisfied at their reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n“By whose permission?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Holy Four,” answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught\\r\\nhim that that was the highest authority to which he could refer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nine from seven,” cried the sentinel.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Seven from five,” returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the\\r\\ncountersign which he had heard in the garden.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pass, and the Lord go with you,” said the voice from above. Beyond his\\r\\npost the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a\\r\\ntrot. Looking back, they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon\\r\\nhis gun, and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen\\r\\npeople, and that freedom lay before them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V.\\r\\nTHE AVENGING ANGELS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular\\r\\nand rock-strewn paths. More than once they lost their way, but Hope’s\\r\\nintimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track\\r\\nonce more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage\\r\\nbeauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks\\r\\nhemmed them in, peeping over each other’s shoulders to the far horizon.\\r\\nSo steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch\\r\\nand the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only\\r\\na gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear\\r\\nentirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with\\r\\ntrees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they\\r\\npassed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which\\r\\nwoke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses\\r\\ninto a gallop.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great\\r\\nmountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until\\r\\nthey were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the\\r\\nhearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild\\r\\ntorrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered\\r\\ntheir horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her\\r\\nfather would fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was\\r\\ninexorable. “They will be upon our track by this time,” he said.\\r\\n“Everything depends upon our speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for\\r\\nthe remainder of our lives.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and\\r\\nby evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from\\r\\ntheir enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag,\\r\\nwhere the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there\\r\\nhuddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours’ sleep. Before\\r\\ndaybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had\\r\\nseen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that\\r\\nthey were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose\\r\\nenmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could\\r\\nreach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store\\r\\nof provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness,\\r\\nhowever, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had\\r\\nfrequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life.\\r\\nChoosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and\\r\\nmade a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for\\r\\nthey were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the\\r\\nair was bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy\\r\\nadieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of\\r\\nwhatever chance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man\\r\\nand the young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three\\r\\nanimals stood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks\\r\\nhid them from his view.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another\\r\\nwithout success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and\\r\\nother indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the\\r\\nvicinity. At last, after two or three hours’ fruitless search, he was\\r\\nthinking of turning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he\\r\\nsaw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the\\r\\nedge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there\\r\\nstood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed\\r\\nwith a pair of gigantic horns. The big-horn—for so it is called—was\\r\\nacting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to\\r\\nthe hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction,\\r\\nand had not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon\\r\\na rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The\\r\\nanimal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the\\r\\nprecipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself\\r\\nwith cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy\\r\\nover his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening\\r\\nwas already drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he\\r\\nrealized the difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had\\r\\nwandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no\\r\\neasy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in\\r\\nwhich he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which\\r\\nwere so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from\\r\\nthe other. He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a\\r\\nmountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before.\\r\\nConvinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with\\r\\nthe same result. Night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark\\r\\nbefore he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him.\\r\\nEven then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the\\r\\nmoon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the\\r\\nobscurity more profound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary from\\r\\nhis exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the\\r\\nreflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he\\r\\ncarried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their\\r\\njourney.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left\\r\\nthem. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs\\r\\nwhich bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously,\\r\\nfor he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart\\r\\nhe put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud\\r\\nhalloo as a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an\\r\\nanswer. None came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary\\r\\nsilent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless\\r\\nrepetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again no\\r\\nwhisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time\\r\\nago. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards\\r\\nfrantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the\\r\\nfire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there,\\r\\nbut it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead\\r\\nsilence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to\\r\\nconvictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the\\r\\nremains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only\\r\\ntoo clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during\\r\\nhis absence—a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no\\r\\ntraces behind it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin\\r\\nround, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He\\r\\nwas essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from\\r\\nhis temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the\\r\\nsmouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help\\r\\nto examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet\\r\\nof horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the\\r\\nfugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had\\r\\nafterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of\\r\\nhis companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself\\r\\nthat they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which\\r\\nmade every nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one\\r\\nside of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had\\r\\nassuredly not been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything\\r\\nbut a newly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived\\r\\nthat a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the\\r\\ncleft fork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the\\r\\npoint:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJOHN FERRIER,\\r\\nFORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY,\\r\\nDied August 4th, 1860.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone,\\r\\nthen, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round\\r\\nto see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy\\r\\nhad been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original\\r\\ndestiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder’s son. As the young\\r\\nfellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to\\r\\nprevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in\\r\\nhis last silent resting-place.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs\\r\\nfrom despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least\\r\\ndevote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance,\\r\\nJefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness,\\r\\nwhich he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived.\\r\\nAs he stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which\\r\\ncould assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution,\\r\\nbrought by his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring\\r\\nenergy should, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim,\\r\\nwhite face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and\\r\\nhaving stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him\\r\\nfor a few days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he\\r\\nset himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the\\r\\navenging angels.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he\\r\\nhad already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down\\r\\namong the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak\\r\\nhe was always well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle\\r\\nCañon, from which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he\\r\\ncould look down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he\\r\\nleaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent\\r\\nwidespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that there\\r\\nwere flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of\\r\\nfestivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he\\r\\nheard the clatter of horse’s hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding\\r\\ntowards him. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named\\r\\nCowper, to whom he had rendered services at different times. He\\r\\ntherefore accosted him when he got up to him, with the object of\\r\\nfinding out what Lucy Ferrier’s fate had been.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am Jefferson Hope,” he said. “You remember me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment—indeed, it was\\r\\ndifficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly\\r\\nwhite face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former\\r\\ndays. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity,\\r\\nthe man’s surprise changed to consternation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are mad to come here,” he cried. “It is as much as my own life is\\r\\nworth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from\\r\\nthe Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t fear them, or their warrant,” Hope said, earnestly. “You must\\r\\nknow something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you\\r\\nhold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For\\r\\nGod’s sake, don’t refuse to answer me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it?” the Mormon asked uneasily. “Be quick. The very rocks have\\r\\nears and the trees eyes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What has become of Lucy Ferrier?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you\\r\\nhave no life left in you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t mind me,” said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and\\r\\nhad sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. “Married,\\r\\nyou say?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Married yesterday—that’s what those flags are for on the Endowment\\r\\nHouse. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson\\r\\nas to which was to have her. They’d both been in the party that\\r\\nfollowed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give\\r\\nhim the best claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber’s\\r\\nparty was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one\\r\\nwon’t have her very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday.\\r\\nShe is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I am off,” said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. His\\r\\nface might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its\\r\\nexpression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where are you going?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never mind,” he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder,\\r\\nstrode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains\\r\\nto the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so\\r\\nfierce and so dangerous as himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it\\r\\nwas the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful\\r\\nmarriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her\\r\\nhead again, but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish\\r\\nhusband, who had married her principally for the sake of John Ferrier’s\\r\\nproperty, did not affect any great grief at his bereavement; but his\\r\\nother wives mourned over her, and sat up with her the night before the\\r\\nburial, as is the Mormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in\\r\\nthe early hours of the morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and\\r\\nastonishment, the door was flung open, and a savage-looking,\\r\\nweather-beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room. Without a\\r\\nglance or a word to the cowering women, he walked up to the white\\r\\nsilent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier.\\r\\nStooping over her, he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead,\\r\\nand then, snatching up her hand, he took the wedding-ring from her\\r\\nfinger. “She shall not be buried in that,” he cried with a fierce\\r\\nsnarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and\\r\\nwas gone. So strange and so brief was the episode, that the watchers\\r\\nmight have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other\\r\\npeople of it, had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet\\r\\nof gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a\\r\\nstrange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for\\r\\nvengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird\\r\\nfigure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the\\r\\nlonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson’s\\r\\nwindow and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On\\r\\nanother occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder\\r\\ncrashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing\\r\\nhimself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in\\r\\ndiscovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led\\r\\nrepeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or\\r\\nkilling their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the\\r\\nprecaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having\\r\\ntheir houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these\\r\\nmeasures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and\\r\\nthey hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.\\r\\n\\r\\nFar from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter’s mind\\r\\nwas of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge\\r\\nhad taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any\\r\\nother emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soon\\r\\nrealized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant\\r\\nstrain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome\\r\\nfood were wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains,\\r\\nwhat was to become of his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure\\r\\nto overtake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play his\\r\\nenemy’s game, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there\\r\\nto recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue\\r\\nhis object without privation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a\\r\\ncombination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines\\r\\nfor nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory of his\\r\\nwrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that\\r\\nmemorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier’s grave. Disguised,\\r\\nand under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless what\\r\\nbecame of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to be\\r\\njustice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a\\r\\nschism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger\\r\\nmembers of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the\\r\\nElders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of\\r\\nthe malcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had\\r\\nbeen Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone.\\r\\nRumour reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his\\r\\nproperty into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his\\r\\ncompanion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. There was no clue at\\r\\nall, however, as to their whereabouts.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of\\r\\nrevenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never\\r\\nfaltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked out\\r\\nby such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town\\r\\nthrough the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into\\r\\nyear, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human\\r\\nbloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he\\r\\nhad devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was but\\r\\na glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that\\r\\nCleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He\\r\\nreturned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all\\r\\narranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window,\\r\\nhad recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in his\\r\\neyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by\\r\\nStangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to\\r\\nhim that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and\\r\\nhatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into\\r\\ncustody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some\\r\\nweeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that\\r\\nDrebber’s house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had\\r\\ndeparted for Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred\\r\\nurged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and for\\r\\nsome time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his\\r\\napproaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in\\r\\nhim, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to city,\\r\\nworking his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the\\r\\nfugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris;\\r\\nand when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off\\r\\nfor Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for\\r\\nthey had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running\\r\\nthem to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than\\r\\nquote the old hunter’s own account, as duly recorded in Dr. Watson’s\\r\\nJournal, to which we are already under such obligations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI.\\r\\nA CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON, M.D.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOur prisoner’s furious resistance did not apparently indicate any\\r\\nferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself\\r\\npowerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes that\\r\\nhe had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. “I guess you’re going to take\\r\\nme to the police-station,” he remarked to Sherlock Holmes. “My cab’s at\\r\\nthe door. If you’ll loose my legs I’ll walk down to it. I’m not so\\r\\nlight to lift as I used to be.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this\\r\\nproposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at\\r\\nhis word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ankles.\\r\\nHe rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself that they\\r\\nwere free once more. I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed\\r\\nhim, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man; and his dark\\r\\nsunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was\\r\\nas formidable as his personal strength.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If there’s a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you are\\r\\nthe man for it,” he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my\\r\\nfellow-lodger. “The way you kept on my trail was a caution.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You had better come with me,” said Holmes to the two detectives.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can drive you,” said Lestrade.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have\\r\\ntaken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made no\\r\\nattempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his,\\r\\nand we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse,\\r\\nand brought us in a very short time to our destination. We were ushered\\r\\ninto a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner’s\\r\\nname and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged.\\r\\nThe official was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through his\\r\\nduties in a dull mechanical way. “The prisoner will be put before the\\r\\nmagistrates in the course of the week,” he said; “in the mean time, Mr.\\r\\nJefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn you\\r\\nthat your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve got a good deal to say,” our prisoner said slowly. “I want to\\r\\ntell you gentlemen all about it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hadn’t you better reserve that for your trial?” asked the Inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I may never be tried,” he answered. “You needn’t look startled. It\\r\\nisn’t suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?” He turned his fierce\\r\\ndark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes; I am,” I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then put your hand here,” he said, with a smile, motioning with his\\r\\nmanacled wrists towards his chest.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing\\r\\nand commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed\\r\\nto thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some\\r\\npowerful engine was at work. In the silence of the room I could hear a\\r\\ndull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why,” I cried, “you have an aortic aneurism!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s what they call it,” he said, placidly. “I went to a Doctor last\\r\\nweek about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before many\\r\\ndays passed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from\\r\\nover-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I’ve\\r\\ndone my work now, and I don’t care how soon I go, but I should like to\\r\\nleave some account of the business behind me. I don’t want to be\\r\\nremembered as a common cut-throat.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the\\r\\nadvisability of allowing him to tell his story.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?” the former\\r\\nasked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Most certainly there is,” I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to\\r\\ntake his statement,” said the Inspector. “You are at liberty, sir, to\\r\\ngive your account, which I again warn you will be taken down.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll sit down, with your leave,” the prisoner said, suiting the action\\r\\nto the word. “This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the\\r\\ntussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I’m on the brink\\r\\nof the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I say is\\r\\nthe absolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to\\r\\nme.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWith these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began the\\r\\nfollowing remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical\\r\\nmanner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough.\\r\\nI can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had\\r\\naccess to Lestrade’s note-book, in which the prisoner’s words were\\r\\ntaken down exactly as they were uttered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It don’t much matter to you why I hated these men,” he said; “it’s\\r\\nenough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings—a father\\r\\nand a daughter—and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own lives.\\r\\nAfter the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was\\r\\nimpossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. I\\r\\nknew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge,\\r\\njury, and executioner all rolled into one. You’d have done the same, if\\r\\nyou have any manhood in you, if you had been in my place.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. She\\r\\nwas forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart over\\r\\nit. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that his\\r\\ndying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughts\\r\\nshould be of the crime for which he was punished. I have carried it\\r\\nabout with me, and have followed him and his accomplice over two\\r\\ncontinents until I caught them. They thought to tire me out, but they\\r\\ncould not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is likely enough, I die knowing\\r\\nthat my work in this world is done, and well done. They have perished,\\r\\nand by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to\\r\\nfollow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I\\r\\nfound that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and\\r\\nriding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner’s\\r\\noffice, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to\\r\\nthe owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There\\r\\nwas seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The\\r\\nhardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the\\r\\nmazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had\\r\\na map beside me though, and when once I had spotted the principal\\r\\nhotels and stations, I got on pretty well.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were\\r\\nliving; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across\\r\\nthem. They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other\\r\\nside of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at\\r\\nmy mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their\\r\\nrecognizing me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my\\r\\nopportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about\\r\\nLondon, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my\\r\\ncab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they\\r\\ncould not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or late at\\r\\nnight that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand\\r\\nwith my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay\\r\\nmy hand upon the men I wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was\\r\\nsome chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone,\\r\\nand never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every\\r\\nday, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half\\r\\nthe time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them\\r\\nlate and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not\\r\\ndiscouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. My\\r\\nonly fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon\\r\\nand leave my work undone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the\\r\\nstreet was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to\\r\\ntheir door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time\\r\\nDrebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my\\r\\nhorse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I\\r\\nfeared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station\\r\\nthey got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on\\r\\nto the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the\\r\\nguard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for\\r\\nsome hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was\\r\\nrather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle\\r\\nthat I could hear every word that passed between them. Drebber said\\r\\nthat he had a little business of his own to do, and that if the other\\r\\nwould wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated\\r\\nwith him, and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together.\\r\\nDrebber answered that the matter was a delicate one, and that he must\\r\\ngo alone. I could not catch what Stangerson said to that, but the other\\r\\nburst out swearing, and reminded him that he was nothing more than his\\r\\npaid servant, and that he must not presume to dictate to him. On that\\r\\nthe Secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him\\r\\nthat if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday’s\\r\\nPrivate Hotel; to which Drebber answered that he would be back on the\\r\\nplatform before eleven, and made his way out of the station.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my\\r\\nenemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but\\r\\nsingly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue\\r\\nprecipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction\\r\\nin vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that\\r\\nstrikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans\\r\\narranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who\\r\\nhad wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It\\r\\nchanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in\\r\\nlooking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one\\r\\nof them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and returned;\\r\\nbut in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate\\r\\nconstructed. By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this\\r\\ngreat city where I could rely upon being free from interruption. How to\\r\\nget Drebber to that house was the difficult problem which I had now to\\r\\nsolve.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying\\r\\nfor nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out he\\r\\nstaggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a\\r\\nhansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so close\\r\\nthat the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole\\r\\nway. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets,\\r\\nuntil, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in\\r\\nwhich he had boarded. I could not imagine what his intention was in\\r\\nreturning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or\\r\\nso from the house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away. Give me a\\r\\nglass of water, if you please. My mouth gets dry with the talking.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI handed him the glass, and he drank it down.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s better,” he said. “Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or\\r\\nmore, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside\\r\\nthe house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared,\\r\\none of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had\\r\\nnever seen before. This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they\\r\\ncame to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent\\r\\nhim half across the road. ‘You hound,’ he cried, shaking his stick at\\r\\nhim; ‘I’ll teach you to insult an honest girl!’ He was so hot that I\\r\\nthink he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur\\r\\nstaggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He\\r\\nran as far as the corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and\\r\\njumped in. ‘Drive me to Halliday’s Private Hotel,’ said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that\\r\\nI feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove\\r\\nalong slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I might\\r\\ntake him right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane\\r\\nhave my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this, when\\r\\nhe solved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again,\\r\\nand he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leaving\\r\\nword that I should wait for him. There he remained until closing time,\\r\\nand when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my\\r\\nown hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only\\r\\nhave been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself\\r\\nto do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for his life\\r\\nif he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets which I\\r\\nhave filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor and\\r\\nsweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day the professor\\r\\nwas lecturing on poisons, and he showed his students some alkaloid, as\\r\\nhe called it, which he had extracted from some South American arrow\\r\\npoison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant\\r\\ndeath. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and\\r\\nwhen they were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a\\r\\nfairly good dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble\\r\\npills, and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without\\r\\nthe poison. I determined at the time that when I had my chance, my\\r\\ngentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I\\r\\nate the pill that remained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good\\r\\ndeal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief. From that day I had\\r\\nalways my pill boxes about with me, and the time had now come when I\\r\\nwas to use them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard\\r\\nand raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within—so\\r\\nglad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you\\r\\ngentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty\\r\\nlong years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would\\r\\nunderstand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my\\r\\nnerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with\\r\\nexcitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy\\r\\nlooking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I\\r\\nsee you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on\\r\\neach side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton\\r\\nRoad.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the\\r\\ndripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber\\r\\nall huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, ‘It’s\\r\\ntime to get out,’ I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘All right, cabby,’ said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned,\\r\\nfor he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden. I\\r\\nhad to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little\\r\\ntop-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the\\r\\nfront room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the\\r\\ndaughter were walking in front of us.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘It’s infernally dark,’ said he, stamping about.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘We’ll soon have a light,’ I said, striking a match and putting it to\\r\\na wax candle which I had brought with me. ‘Now, Enoch Drebber,’ I\\r\\ncontinued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, ‘who\\r\\nam I?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“He gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw\\r\\na horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which\\r\\nshowed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I\\r\\nsaw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered\\r\\nin his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and\\r\\nlaughed loud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be\\r\\nsweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now\\r\\npossessed me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘You dog!’ I said; ‘I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St.\\r\\nPetersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your\\r\\nwanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see\\r\\nto-morrow’s sun rise.’ He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I\\r\\ncould see on his face that he thought I was mad. So I was for the time.\\r\\nThe pulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers, and I believe I\\r\\nwould have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my\\r\\nnose and relieved me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?’ I cried, locking the door,\\r\\nand shaking the key in his face. ‘Punishment has been slow in coming,\\r\\nbut it has overtaken you at last.’ I saw his coward lips tremble as I\\r\\nspoke. He would have begged for his life, but he knew well that it was\\r\\nuseless.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Would you murder me?’ he stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘There is no murder,’ I answered. ‘Who talks of murdering a mad dog?\\r\\nWhat mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her\\r\\nslaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless\\r\\nharem.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘It was not I who killed her father,’ he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘But it was you who broke her innocent heart,’ I shrieked, thrusting\\r\\nthe box before him. ‘Let the high God judge between us. Choose and eat.\\r\\nThere is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you\\r\\nleave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are\\r\\nruled by chance.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my\\r\\nknife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I\\r\\nswallowed the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a\\r\\nminute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die.\\r\\nShall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first\\r\\nwarning pangs told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as\\r\\nI saw it, and held Lucy’s marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was\\r\\nbut for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm of\\r\\npain contorted his features; he threw his hands out in front of him,\\r\\nstaggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I\\r\\nturned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There\\r\\nwas no movement. He was dead!\\r\\n\\r\\n“The blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice\\r\\nof it. I don’t know what it was that put it into my head to write upon\\r\\nthe wall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the\\r\\npolice upon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I\\r\\nremembered a German being found in New York with RACHE written up above\\r\\nhim, and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret\\r\\nsocieties must have done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New\\r\\nYorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own\\r\\nblood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall. Then I walked\\r\\ndown to my cab and found that there was nobody about, and that the\\r\\nnight was still very wild. I had driven some distance when I put my\\r\\nhand into the pocket in which I usually kept Lucy’s ring, and found\\r\\nthat it was not there. I was thunderstruck at this, for it was the only\\r\\nmemento that I had of her. Thinking that I might have dropped it when I\\r\\nstooped over Drebber’s body, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side\\r\\nstreet, I went boldly up to the house—for I was ready to dare anything\\r\\nrather than lose the ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into\\r\\nthe arms of a police-officer who was coming out, and only managed to\\r\\ndisarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was\\r\\nto do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier’s debt. I\\r\\nknew that he was staying at Halliday’s Private Hotel, and I hung about\\r\\nall day, but he never came out. I fancy that he suspected something\\r\\nwhen Drebber failed to put in an appearance. He was cunning, was\\r\\nStangerson, and always on his guard. If he thought he could keep me off\\r\\nby staying indoors he was very much mistaken. I soon found out which\\r\\nwas the window of his bedroom, and early next morning I took advantage\\r\\nof some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so\\r\\nmade my way into his room in the grey of the dawn. I woke him up and\\r\\ntold him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he\\r\\nhad taken so long before. I described Drebber’s death to him, and I\\r\\ngave him the same choice of the poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at\\r\\nthe chance of safety which that offered him, he sprang from his bed and\\r\\nflew at my throat. In self-defence I stabbed him to the heart. It would\\r\\nhave been the same in any case, for Providence would never have allowed\\r\\nhis guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have little more to say, and it’s as well, for I am about done up. I\\r\\nwent on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I\\r\\ncould save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the\\r\\nyard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called\\r\\nJefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at\\r\\n221B, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next\\r\\nthing I knew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and\\r\\nas neatly shackled as ever I saw in my life. That’s the whole of my\\r\\nstory, gentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that\\r\\nI am just as much an officer of justice as you are.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo thrilling had the man’s narrative been, and his manner was so\\r\\nimpressive that we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professional\\r\\ndetectives, _blasé_ as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to\\r\\nbe keenly interested in the man’s story. When he finished we sat for\\r\\nsome minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of\\r\\nLestrade’s pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand\\r\\naccount.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is only one point on which I should like a little more\\r\\ninformation,” Sherlock Holmes said at last. “Who was your accomplice\\r\\nwho came for the ring which I advertised?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. “I can tell my own secrets,”\\r\\nhe said, “but I don’t get other people into trouble. I saw your\\r\\nadvertisement, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might be the\\r\\nring which I wanted. My friend volunteered to go and see. I think\\r\\nyou’ll own he did it smartly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not a doubt of that,” said Holmes heartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, gentlemen,” the Inspector remarked gravely, “the forms of the law\\r\\nmust be complied with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before\\r\\nthe magistrates, and your attendance will be required. Until then I\\r\\nwill be responsible for him.” He rang the bell as he spoke, and\\r\\nJefferson Hope was led off by a couple of warders, while my friend and\\r\\nI made our way out of the Station and took a cab back to Baker Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII.\\r\\nTHE CONCLUSION.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the\\r\\nThursday; but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our\\r\\ntestimony. A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson\\r\\nHope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would be\\r\\nmeted out to him. On the very night after his capture the aneurism\\r\\nburst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the\\r\\ncell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been able in\\r\\nhis dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work well\\r\\ndone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,” Holmes remarked,\\r\\nas we chatted it over next evening. “Where will their grand\\r\\nadvertisement be now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t see that they had very much to do with his capture,” I\\r\\nanswered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,” returned my\\r\\ncompanion, bitterly. “The question is, what can you make people believe\\r\\nthat you have done. Never mind,” he continued, more brightly, after a\\r\\npause. “I would not have missed the investigation for anything. There\\r\\nhas been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there\\r\\nwere several most instructive points about it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Simple!” I ejaculated.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,” said Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes, smiling at my surprise. “The proof of its intrinsic simplicity\\r\\nis, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was\\r\\nable to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is true,” said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is\\r\\nusually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this\\r\\nsort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very\\r\\nuseful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise\\r\\nit much. In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason\\r\\nforwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who\\r\\ncan reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I confess,” said I, “that I do not quite follow you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer.\\r\\nMost people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you\\r\\nwhat the result would be. They can put those events together in their\\r\\nminds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are\\r\\nfew people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to\\r\\nevolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led\\r\\nup to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning\\r\\nbackwards, or analytically.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I understand,” said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find\\r\\neverything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you the\\r\\ndifferent steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I\\r\\napproached the house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely\\r\\nfree from all impressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway,\\r\\nand there, as I have already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks\\r\\nof a cab, which, I ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during\\r\\nthe night. I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private\\r\\ncarriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler\\r\\nis considerably less wide than a gentleman’s brougham.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden\\r\\npath, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable\\r\\nfor taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere\\r\\ntrampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its\\r\\nsurface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which is\\r\\nso important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps.\\r\\nHappily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice has\\r\\nmade it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the\\r\\nconstables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first\\r\\npassed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been\\r\\nbefore the others, because in places their marks had been entirely\\r\\nobliterated by the others coming upon the top of them. In this way my\\r\\nsecond link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were\\r\\ntwo in number, one remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the\\r\\nlength of his stride), and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from\\r\\nthe small and elegant impression left by his boots.\\r\\n\\r\\n“On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My\\r\\nwell-booted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder,\\r\\nif murder there was. There was no wound upon the dead man’s person, but\\r\\nthe agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen\\r\\nhis fate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or\\r\\nany sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon\\r\\ntheir features. Having sniffed the dead man’s lips I detected a\\r\\nslightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had\\r\\npoison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon\\r\\nhim from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of\\r\\nexclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would\\r\\nmeet the facts. Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The\\r\\nforcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in\\r\\ncriminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in\\r\\nMontpellier, will occur at once to any toxicologist.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not\\r\\nbeen the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics,\\r\\nthen, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me. I\\r\\nwas inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political\\r\\nassassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder\\r\\nhad, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator\\r\\nhad left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there\\r\\nall the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political\\r\\none, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription\\r\\nwas discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my\\r\\nopinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found,\\r\\nhowever, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to\\r\\nremind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point\\r\\nthat I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to\\r\\nCleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber’s former career. He\\r\\nanswered, you remember, in the negative.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which\\r\\nconfirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer’s height, and furnished\\r\\nme with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the\\r\\nlength of his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there\\r\\nwere no signs of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had\\r\\nburst from the murderer’s nose in his excitement. I could perceive that\\r\\nthe track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom\\r\\nthat any man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way\\r\\nthrough emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was\\r\\nprobably a robust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged\\r\\ncorrectly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Having left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I\\r\\ntelegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry\\r\\nto the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The\\r\\nanswer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for\\r\\nthe protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson\\r\\nHope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that\\r\\nI held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to\\r\\nsecure the murderer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked\\r\\ninto the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven\\r\\nthe cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on\\r\\nin a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in\\r\\ncharge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside\\r\\nthe house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry\\r\\nout a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third\\r\\nperson, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished to\\r\\ndog another through London, what better means could he adopt than to\\r\\nturn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible\\r\\nconclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the\\r\\nMetropolis.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased\\r\\nto be. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would\\r\\nbe likely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time\\r\\nat least, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to\\r\\nsuppose that he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change\\r\\nhis name in a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore\\r\\norganized my Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically\\r\\nto every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that\\r\\nI wanted. How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of\\r\\nit, are still fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was\\r\\nan incident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in\\r\\nany case have been prevented. Through it, as you know, I came into\\r\\npossession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised.\\r\\nYou see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break\\r\\nor flaw.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is wonderful!” I cried. “Your merits should be publicly recognized.\\r\\nYou should publish an account of the case. If you won’t, I will for\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You may do what you like, Doctor,” he answered. “See here!” he\\r\\ncontinued, handing a paper over to me, “look at this!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the _Echo_ for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed\\r\\nwas devoted to the case in question.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The public,” it said, “have lost a sensational treat through the\\r\\nsudden death of the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr.\\r\\nEnoch Drebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The details of the case\\r\\nwill probably be never known now, though we are informed upon good\\r\\nauthority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic\\r\\nfeud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part. It seems that both the\\r\\nvictims belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and\\r\\nHope, the deceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City. If the\\r\\ncase has had no other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most\\r\\nstriking manner the efficiency of our detective police force, and will\\r\\nserve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle\\r\\ntheir feuds at home, and not to carry them on to British soil. It is an\\r\\nopen secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to\\r\\nthe well-known Scotland Yard officials, Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson.\\r\\nThe man was apprehended, it appears, in the rooms of a certain Mr.\\r\\nSherlock Holmes, who has himself, as an amateur, shown some talent in\\r\\nthe detective line, and who, with such instructors, may hope in time to\\r\\nattain to some degree of their skill. It is expected that a testimonial\\r\\nof some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting\\r\\nrecognition of their services.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Didn’t I tell you so when we started?” cried Sherlock Holmes with a\\r\\nlaugh. “That’s the result of all our Study in Scarlet: to get them a\\r\\ntestimonial!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never mind,” I answered, “I have all the facts in my journal, and the\\r\\npublic shall know them. In the meantime you must make yourself\\r\\ncontented by the consciousness of success, like the Roman miser—\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo\\r\\nIpse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca.’”'"

PART I. _Being a reprint from the Reminiscences of_ JOHN H. WATSON, M.D., _Late of the Army Medical Department._ CHAPTER I. MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES. In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy s country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new duties. The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a packhorse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines. Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship  Orontes,  and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it. I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as air or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile. On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at the Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at Barts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and we started off together in a hansom.  Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?  he asked in undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.  You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.  I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination.  Poor devil!  he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my misfortunes.  What are you up to now?   Looking for lodgings,  I answered.  Trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.   That s a strange thing,  remarked my companion  you are the second man today that has used that expression to me.   And who was the first?  I asked.  A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital. He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which were too much for his purse.   By Jove!  I cried,  if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner to being alone.  Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wineglass.  You don t know Sherlock Holmes yet,  he said  perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion.   Why, what is there against him?   Oh, I didn t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer in his ideas an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I know he is a decent fellow enough.   A medical student, I suppose?  said I.  No I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well up in anatomy, and he is a firstclass chemist but, as far as I know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of outofthe way knowledge which would astonish his professors.   Did you never ask him what he was going in for?  I asked.  No he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him.   I should like to meet him,  I said.  If I am to lodge with anyone, I should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How could I meet this friend of yours?   He is sure to be at the laboratory,  returned my companion.  He either avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to night. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.   Certainly,  I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other channels. As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellowlodger.  You mustn t blame me if you don t get on with him,  he said  I know nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me responsible.   If we don t get on it will be easy to part company,  I answered.  It seems to me, Stamford,  I added, looking hard at my companion,  that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow s temper so formidable, or what is it? Don t be mealymouthed about it.   It is not easy to express the inexpressible,  he answered with a laugh.  Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes it approaches to coldbloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge.   Very right too.   Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the subjects in the dissectingrooms with a stick, it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape.   Beating the subjects!   Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him at it with my own eyes.   And yet you say he is not a medical student?   No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are, and you must form your own impressions about him.  As he spoke, we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small sidedoor, which opened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me, and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and duncoloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory. This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles. Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, testtubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames. There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure.  I ve found it! I ve found it,  he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a testtube in his hand.  I have found a reagent which is precipitated by h moglobin, and by nothing else.  Had he discovered a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.  Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,  said Stamford, introducing us.  How are you?  he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for which I should hardly have given him credit.  You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive.   How on earth did you know that?  I asked in astonishment.  Never mind,  said he, chuckling to himself.  The question now is about h moglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?   It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,  I answered,  but practically   Why, man, it is the most practical medicolegal discovery for years. Don t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come over here now!  He seized me by the coatsleeve in his eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he had been working.  Let us have some fresh blood,  he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette.  Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.  As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar.  Ha! ha!  he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy.  What do you think of that?   It seems to be a very delicate test,  I remarked.  Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.   Indeed!  I murmured.  Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock Holmes  test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.  His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination.  You are to be congratulated,  I remarked, considerably surprised at his enthusiasm.  There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier, and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive.   You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,  said Stamford with a laugh.  You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the  Police News of the Past.   Very interesting reading it might be made, too,  remarked Sherlock Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger.  I have to be careful,  he continued, turning to me with a smile,  for I dabble with poisons a good deal.  He held out his hand as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong acids.  We came here on business,  said Stamford, sitting down on a high threelegged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his foot.  My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought that I had better bring you together.  Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me.  I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,  he said,  which would suit us down to the ground. You don t mind the smell of strong tobacco, I hope?   I always smoke  ship s  myself,  I answered.  That s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally do experiments. Would that annoy you?   By no means.   Let me see what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at times, and don t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I ll soon be right. What have you to confess now? It s just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together.  I laughed at this crossexamination.  I keep a bull pup,  I said,  and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices when I m well, but those are the principal ones at present.   Do you include violinplaying in your category of rows?  he asked, anxiously.  It depends on the player,  I answered.  A wellplayed violin is a treat for the gods a badlyplayed one   Oh, that s all right,  he cried, with a merry laugh.  I think we may consider the thing as settled that is, if the rooms are agreeable to you.   When shall we see them?   Call for me here at noon tomorrow, and we ll go together and settle everything,  he answered.  All right noon exactly,  said I, shaking his hand. We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards my hotel.  By the way,  I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford,  how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?  My companion smiled an enigmatical smile.  That s just his little peculiarity,  he said.  A good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out.   Oh! a mystery is it?  I cried, rubbing my hands.  This is very piquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together.  The proper study of mankind is man,  you know.   You must study him, then,  Stamford said, as he bade me goodbye.  You ll find him a knotty problem, though. I ll wager he learns more about you than you about him. Goodbye.   Goodbye,  I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably interested in my new acquaintance. CHAPTER II. THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION. We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They consisted of a couple of comfortable bedrooms and a single large airy sittingroom, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings. Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissectingrooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sittingroom, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion. As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded and his thin, hawklike nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments. The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how objectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my attention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these circumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it. He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question, confirmed Stamford s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance into the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view. Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason for doing so. His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.  You appear to be astonished,  he said, smiling at my expression of surprise.  Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.   To forget it!   You see,  he explained,  I consider that a man s brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brainattic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.   But the Solar System!  I protested.  What the deuce is it to me?  he interrupted impatiently  you say that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.  I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I pondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw my deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was exceptionally wellinformed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down. I could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It ran in this way  SHERLOCK HOLMES his limits. 1. Knowledge of Literature. Nil. 2. Philosophy. Nil. 3. Astronomy. Nil. 4. Politics. Feeble. 5. Botany. Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons generally. Knows nothing of practical gardening. 6. Geology. Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different soils from each other. After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers, and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he had received them. 7. Chemistry. Profound. 8. Anatomy. Accurate, but unsystematic. 9. Sensational Literature. Immense. He appears to know every detail of every horror perpetrated in the century. 10. Plays the violin well. 11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman. 12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law. When I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair.  If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all these accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,  I said to myself,  I may as well give up the attempt at once.  I see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These were very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments. That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn s Lieder, and other favourites. When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in his armchair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience. During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently, however, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most different classes of society. There was one little sallow ratfaced, darkeyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came three or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same afternoon brought a greyheaded, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely followed by a slipshod elderly woman. On another occasion an old whitehaired gentleman had an interview with my companion and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sittingroom, and I would retire to my bedroom. He always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience.  I have to use this room as a place of business,  he said,  and these people are my clients.  Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject of his own accord. It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it. Its somewhat ambitious title was  The Book of Life,  and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be farfetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man s inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer.  From a drop of water,  said the writer,  a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study nor, is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems. Let him, on meeting a fellowmortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to which he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look for. By a man s finger nails, by his coatsleeve, by his boot, by his trouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirt cuffs by each of these things a man s calling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.   What ineffable twaddle!  I cried, slapping the magazine down on the table,  I never read such rubbish in my life.   What is it?  asked Sherlock Holmes.  Why, this article,  I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat down to my breakfast.  I see that you have read it since you have marked it. I don t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. It is evidently the theory of some armchair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not practical. I should like to see him clapped down in a third class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his fellowtravellers. I would lay a thousand to one against him.   You would lose your money,  Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly.  As for the article I wrote it myself.   You!   Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The theories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so chimerical are really extremely practical so practical that I depend upon them for my bread and cheese.   And how?  I asked involuntarily.  Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the world. I m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is. Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger ends, it is odd if you can t unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade is a wellknown detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case, and that was what brought him here.   And these other people?   They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all people who are in trouble about something, and want a little enlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and then I pocket my fee.   But do you mean to say,  I said,  that without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they have seen every detail for themselves?   Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.   You were told, no doubt.   Nothing of the sort. I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan. From long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran,  Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.  The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.   It is simple enough as you explain it,  I said, smiling.  You remind me of Edgar Allen Poe s Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories.  Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe.  No doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,  he observed.  Now, in my opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking in on his friends  thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour s silence is really very showy and superficial. He had some analytical genius, no doubt but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.   Have you read Gaboriau s works?  I asked.  Does Lecoq come up to your idea of a detective?  Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically.  Lecoq was a miserable bungler,  he said, in an angry voice  he had only one thing to recommend him, and that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question was how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twentyfour hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a textbook for detectives to teach them what to avoid.  I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired treated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood looking out into the busy street.  This fellow may be very clever,  I said to myself,  but he is certainly very conceited.   There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,  he said, querulously.  What is the use of having brains in our profession. I know well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the result? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it.  I was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought it best to change the topic.  I wonder what that fellow is looking for?  I asked, pointing to a stalwart, plainlydressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had a large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a message.  You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,  said Sherlock Holmes.  Brag and bounce!  thought I to myself.  He knows that I cannot verify his guess.  The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were watching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across the roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps ascending the stair.  For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,  he said, stepping into the room and handing my friend the letter. Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little thought of this when he made that random shot.  May I ask, my lad,  I said, in the blandest voice,  what your trade may be?   Commissionaire, sir,  he said, gruffly.  Uniform away for repairs.   And you were?  I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my companion.  A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right, sir.  He clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was gone. CHAPTER III. THE LAURISTON GARDENS MYSTERY I confess that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companion s theories. My respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking suspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a prearranged episode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could have in taking me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him he had finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant, lacklustre expression which showed mental abstraction.  How in the world did you deduce that?  I asked.  Deduce what?  said he, petulantly.  Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.   I have no time for trifles,  he answered, brusquely then with a smile,  Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts but perhaps it is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that man was a sergeant of Marines?   No, indeed.   It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you were asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the street I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the fellow s hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage, however, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was a man with some amount of selfimportance and a certain air of command. You must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his cane. A steady, respectable, middleaged man, too, on the face of him all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.   Wonderful!  I ejaculated.  Commonplace,  said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that he was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration.  I said just now that there were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong look at this!  He threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought.  Why,  I cried, as I cast my eye over it,  this is terrible!   It does seem to be a little out of the common,  he remarked, calmly.  Would you mind reading it to me aloud?  This is the letter which I read to him   MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,   There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens, off the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in the morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that something was amiss. He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of  Enoch J. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.  There had been no robbery, nor is there any evidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of blood in the room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a loss as to how he came into the empty house indeed, the whole affair is a puzzler. If you can come round to the house any time before twelve, you will find me there. I have left everything _in statu quo_ until I hear from you. If you are unable to come I shall give you fuller details, and would esteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion. Yours faithfully,  TOBIAS GREGSON.   Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,  my friend remarked  he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and energetic, but conventional shockingly so. They have their knives into one another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional beauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put upon the scent.  I was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on.  Surely there is not a moment to be lost,  I cried,  shall I go and order you a cab?   I m not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy devil that ever stood in shoe leather that is, when the fit is on me, for I can be spry enough at times.   Why, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.   My dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel the whole matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will pocket all the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.   But he begs you to help him.   Yes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me but he would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person. However, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my own hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!  He hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that an energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.  Get your hat,  he said.  You wish me to come?   Yes, if you have nothing better to do.  A minute later we were both in a hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road. It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a duncoloured veil hung over the housetops, looking like the reflection of the mudcoloured streets beneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away about Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and an Amati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.  You don t seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,  I said at last, interrupting Holmes  musical disquisition.  No data yet,  he answered.  It is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.   You will have your data soon,  I remarked, pointing with my finger  this is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much mistaken.   So it is. Stop, driver, stop!  We were still a hundred yards or so from it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey upon foot. Number 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an illomened and minatory look. It was one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two being occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and there a  To Let  card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by a threefoot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within. I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be further from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the opposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny, he proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass which flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice he stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it. Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from me. At the door of the house we were met by a tall, whitefaced, flaxenhaired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and wrung my companion s hand with effusion.  It is indeed kind of you to come,  he said,  I have had everything left untouched.   Except that!  my friend answered, pointing at the pathway.  If a herd of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No doubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you permitted this.   I have had so much to do inside the house,  the detective said evasively.  My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him to look after this.  Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically.  With two such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be much for a third party to find out,  he said. Gregson rubbed his hands in a selfsatisfied way.  I think we have done all that can be done,  he answered  it s a queer case though, and I knew your taste for such things.   You did not come here in a cab?  asked Sherlock Holmes.  No, sir.   Nor Lestrade?   No, sir.   Then let us go and look at the room.  With which inconsequent remark he strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features expressed his astonishment. A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of these had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the diningroom, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires. It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was blotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath. Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment. All these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling. It was that of a man about fortythree or fortyfour years of age, middlesized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with lightcoloured trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and apelike appearance, which was increased by his writhing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London. Lestrade, lean and ferretlike as ever, was standing by the doorway, and greeted my companion and myself.  This case will make a stir, sir,  he remarked.  It beats anything I have seen, and I am no chicken.   There is no clue?  said Gregson.  None at all,  chimed in Lestrade. Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it intently.  You are sure that there is no wound?  he asked, pointing to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.  Positive!  cried both detectives.  Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual presumably the murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the year  34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?   No, sir.   Read it up you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It has all been done before.  As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same faraway expression which I have already remarked upon. So swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness with which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the dead man s lips, and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots.  He has not been moved at all?  he asked.  No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.   You can take him to the mortuary now,  he said.  There is nothing more to be learned.  Gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered the room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised him, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes.  There s been a woman here,  he cried.  It s a woman s weddingring.  He held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered round him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.  This complicates matters,  said Gregson.  Heaven knows, they were complicated enough before.   You re sure it doesn t simplify them?  observed Holmes.  There s nothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his pockets?   We have it all here,  said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs.  A gold watch, No. 97163, by Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring, with masonic device. Gold pin bulldog s head, with rubies as eyes. Russian leather cardcase, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland, corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse, but loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition of Boccaccio s _Decameron_, with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the flyleaf. Two letters one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph Stangerson.   At what address?   American Exchange, Strand to be left till called for. They are both from the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their boats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return to New York.   Have you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?   I did it at once, sir,  said Gregson.  I have had advertisements sent to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American Exchange, but he has not returned yet.   Have you sent to Cleveland?   We telegraphed this morning.   How did you word your inquiries?   We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad of any information which could help us.   You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to be crucial?   I asked about Stangerson.   Nothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears to hinge? Will you not telegraph again?   I have said all I have to say,  said Gregson, in an offended voice. Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make some remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we were holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene, rubbing his hands in a pompous and selfsatisfied manner.  Mr. Gregson,  he said,  I have just made a discovery of the highest importance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a careful examination of the walls.  The little man s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his colleague.  Come here,  he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate.  Now, stand there!  He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.  Look at that!  he said, triumphantly. I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a yellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was scrawled in bloodred letters a single word  RACHE.  What do you think of that?  cried the detective, with the air of a showman exhibiting his show.  This was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The murderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where it has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See that candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall.   And what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?  asked Gregson in a depreciatory voice.  Mean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name Rachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark my words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a woman named Rachel has something to do with it. It s all very well for you to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever, but the old hound is the best, when all is said and done.   I really beg your pardon!  said my companion, who had ruffled the little man s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter.  You certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out, and, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the other participant in last night s mystery. I have not had time to examine this room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.  As he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying glass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly about the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once lying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of encouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded of a pureblooded welltrained foxhound as it dashes backwards and forwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes across the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his researches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one place he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor, and packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his glass the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the most minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.  They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,  he remarked with a smile.  It s a very bad definition, but it does apply to detective work.  Gregson and Lestrade had watched the man uvres of their amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently failed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that Sherlock Holmes  smallest actions were all directed towards some definite and practical end.  What do you think of it, sir?  they both asked.  It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume to help you,  remarked my friend.  You are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere.  There was a world of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke.  If you will let me know how your investigations go,  he continued,  I shall be happy to give you any help I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who found the body. Can you give me his name and address?  Lestrade glanced at his notebook.  John Rance,  he said.  He is off duty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.  Holmes took a note of the address.  Come along, Doctor,  he said  we shall go and look him up. I ll tell you one thing which may help you in the case,  he continued, turning to the two detectives.  There has been murder done, and the murderer was a man. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had small feet for his height, wore coarse, squaretoed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a fourwheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and the fingernails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only a few indications, but they may assist you.  Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.  If this man was murdered, how was it done?  asked the former.  Poison,  said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off.  One other thing, Lestrade,  he added, turning round at the door  Rache,  is the German for  revenge  so don t lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.  With which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals openmouthed behind him. CHAPTER IV. WHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL. It was one o clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by Lestrade.  There is nothing like first hand evidence,  he remarked  as a matter of fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as well learn all that is to be learned.   You amaze me, Holmes,  said I.  Surely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.   There s no room for a mistake,  he answered.  The very first thing which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the morning I have Gregson s word for that it follows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two individuals to the house.   That seems simple enough,  said I  but how about the other man s height?   Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from the length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though there is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow s stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of checking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct leads him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing was just over six feet from the ground. It was child s play.   And his age?  I asked.  Well, if a man can stride four and ahalf feet without the smallest effort, he can t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across. Patentleather boots had gone round, and Squaretoes had hopped over. There is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I advocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?   The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,  I suggested.  The writing on the wall was done with a man s forefinger dipped in blood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man s nail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor. It was dark in colour and flakey such an ash as is only made by a Trichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes in fact, I have written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar or of tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type.   And the florid face?  I asked.  Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was right. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.  I passed my hand over my brow.  My head is in a whirl,  I remarked  the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these two men if there were two men into an empty house? What has become of the cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take poison? Where did the blood come from? What was the object of the murderer, since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman s ring there? Above all, why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconciling all these facts.  My companion smiled approvingly.  You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,  he said.  There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up my mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade s discovery it was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German. The A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel. I m not going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick, and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.   I shall never do that,  I answered  you have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.  My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way in which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty.  I ll tell you one other thing,  he said.  Patentleathers and Squaretoes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as possible arminarm, in all probability. When they got inside they walked up and down the room or rather, Patentleathers stood still while Squaretoes walked up and down. I could read all that in the dust and I could read that as he walked he grew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of his strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no doubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I ve told you all I know myself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good working basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want to go to Halle s concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.  This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary byways. In the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand.  That s Audley Court in there,  he said, pointing to a narrow slit in the line of deadcoloured brick.  You ll find me here when you come back.  Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was engraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming. He appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in his slumbers.  I made my report at the office,  he said. Holmes took a halfsovereign from his pocket and played with it pensively.  We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips,  he said.  I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,  the constable answered with his eyes upon the little golden disk.  Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.  Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though determined not to omit anything in his narrative.  I ll tell it ye from the beginning,  he said.  My time is from ten at night to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the  White Hart  but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o clock it began to rain, and I met Harry Murcher him who has the Holland Grove beat and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street atalkin . Presently maybe about two or a little after I thought I would take a look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was precious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down, though a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin  down, thinkin  between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same house. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty on account of him that owns them who won t have the drains seen to, though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o  typhoid fever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the window, and I suspected as something was wrong. When I got to the door   You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,  my companion interrupted.  What did you do that for?  Rance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the utmost amazement upon his features.  Why, that s true, sir,  he said  though how you come to know it, Heaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still and so lonesome, that I thought I d be none the worse for some one with me. I ain t afeared of anything on this side o  the grave but I thought that maybe it was him that died o  the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o  turn, and I walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher s lantern, but there wasn t no sign of him nor of anyone else.   There was no one in the street?   Not a livin  soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself together and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside, so I went into the room where the light was aburnin . There was a candle flickerin  on the mantelpiece a red wax one and by its light I saw   Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times, and you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried the kitchen door, and then  John Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in his eyes.  Where was you hid to see all that?  he cried.  It seems to me that you knows a deal more than you should.  Holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable.  Don t get arresting me for the murder,  he said.  I am one of the hounds and not the wolf Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for that. Go on, though. What did you do next?  Rance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified expression.  I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That brought Murcher and two more to the spot.   Was the street empty then?   Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.   What do you mean?  The constable s features broadened into a grin.  I ve seen many a drunk chap in my time,  he said,  but never anyone so cryin  drunk as that cove. He was at the gate when I came out, aleanin  up agin the railings, and asingin  at the pitch o  his lungs about Columbine s Newfangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn t stand, far less help.   What sort of a man was he?  asked Sherlock Holmes. John Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression.  He was an uncommon drunk sort o  man,  he said.  He d ha  found hisself in the station if we hadn t been so took up.   His face his dress didn t you notice them?  Holmes broke in impatiently.  I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up me and Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower part muffled round   That will do,  cried Holmes.  What became of him?   We d enough to do without lookin  after him,  the policeman said, in an aggrieved voice.  I ll wager he found his way home all right.   How was he dressed?   A brown overcoat.   Had he a whip in his hand?   A whip no.   He must have left it behind,  muttered my companion.  You didn t happen to see or hear a cab after that?   No.   There s a halfsovereign for you,  my companion said, standing up and taking his hat.  I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the force. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. You might have gained your sergeant s stripes last night. The man whom you held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and whom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it now I tell you that it is so. Come along, Doctor.  We started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous, but obviously uncomfortable.  The blundering fool,  Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our lodgings.  Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good luck, and not taking advantage of it.   I am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of this man tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. But why should he come back to the house after leaving it? That is not the way of criminals.   The ring, man, the ring that was what he came back for. If we have no other way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. I shall have him, Doctor I ll lay you two to one that I have him. I must thank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you, and so have missed the finest study I ever came across a study in scarlet, eh? Why shouldn t we use a little art jargon. There s the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it. And now for lunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack and her bowing are splendid. What s that little thing of Chopin s she plays so magnificently Tralalaliraliralay.  Leaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a lark while I meditated upon the manysidedness of the human mind. CHAPTER V. OUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR. Our morning s exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was tired out in the afternoon. After Holmes  departure for the concert, I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours  sleep. It was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted baboonlike countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that I found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its owner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most malignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the depravity of the victim was no condonement in the eyes of the law. The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion s hypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he had sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something which had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what had caused the man s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of strangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist. As long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would be no easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet selfconfident manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained all the facts, though what it was I could not for an instant conjecture. He was very late in returning so late, that I knew that the concert could not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table before he appeared.  It was magnificent,  he said, as he took his seat.  Do you remember what Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood.   That s rather a broad idea,  I remarked.  One s ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature,  he answered.  What s the matter? You re not looking quite yourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.   To tell the truth, it has,  I said.  I ought to be more casehardened after my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at Maiwand without losing my nerve.   I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you seen the evening paper?   No.   It gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the fact that when the man was raised up, a woman s wedding ring fell upon the floor. It is just as well it does not.   Why?   Look at this advertisement,  he answered.  I had one sent to every paper this morning immediately after the affair.  He threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated. It was the first announcement in the  Found  column.  In Brixton Road, this morning,  it ran,  a plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway between the  White Hart  Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson, 221B, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening.   Excuse my using your name,  he said.  If I used my own some of these dunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.   That is all right,  I answered.  But supposing anyone applies, I have no ring.   Oh yes, you have,  said he, handing me one.  This will do very well. It is almost a facsimile.   And who do you expect will answer this advertisement.   Why, the man in the brown coat our florid friend with the square toes. If he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.   Would he not consider it as too dangerous?   Not at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason to believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose the ring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebber s body, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the house he discovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police already in possession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning. He had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put yourself in that man s place. On thinking the matter over, it must have occurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving the house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly look out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found. His eye, of course, would light upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why should he fear a trap? There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder. He would come. He will come. You shall see him within an hour?   And then?  I asked.  Oh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?   I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.   You had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man, and though I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for anything.  I went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with the pistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.  The plot thickens,  he said, as I entered  I have just had an answer to my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.   And that is?  I asked eagerly.  My fiddle would be the better for new strings,  he remarked.  Put your pistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an ordinary way. Leave the rest to me. Don t frighten him by looking at him too hard.   It is eight o clock now,  I said, glancing at my watch.  Yes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door slightly. That will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you! This is a queer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday De Jure inter Gentes published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642. Charles  head was still firm on his shoulders when this little brownbacked volume was struck off.   Who is the printer?   Philippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the flyleaf, in very faded ink, is written  Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.  I wonder who William Whyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His writing has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think.  As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the servant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she opened it.  Does Dr. Watson live here?  asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We could not hear the servant s reply, but the door closed, and some one began to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling one. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he listened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a feeble tap at the door.  Come in,  I cried. At my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be dazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket with nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do to keep my countenance. The old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our advertisement.  It s this as has brought me, good gentlemen,  she said, dropping another curtsey  a gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road. It belongs to my girl Sally, as was married only this time twelvemonth, which her husband is steward aboard a Union boat, and what he d say if he come  ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think, he being short enough at the best o  times, but more especially when he has the drink. If it please you, she went to the circus last night along with   Is that her ring?  I asked.  The Lord be thanked!  cried the old woman  Sally will be a glad woman this night. That s the ring.   And what may your address be?  I inquired, taking up a pencil.  13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here.   The Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,  said Sherlock Holmes sharply. The old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little redrimmed eyes.  The gentleman asked me for _my_ address,  she said.  Sally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.   And your name is ?   My name is Sawyer her s is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her and a smart, clean lad, too, as long as he s at sea, and no steward in the company more thought of but when on shore, what with the women and what with liquor shops   Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,  I interrupted, in obedience to a sign from my companion  it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner.  With many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone packed it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs. Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into his room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and a cravat.  I ll follow her,  he said, hurriedly  she must be an accomplice, and will lead me to him. Wait up for me.  The hall door had hardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended the stair. Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly along the other side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind.  Either his whole theory is incorrect,  I thought to myself,  or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery.  There was no need for him to ask me to wait up for him, for I felt that sleep was impossible until I heard the result of his adventure. It was close upon nine when he set out. I had no idea how long he might be, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of Henri Murger s  Vie de Boh me.  Ten o clock passed, and I heard the footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven, and the more stately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same destination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of his latchkey. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not been successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the mastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a hearty laugh.  I wouldn t have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,  he cried, dropping into his chair  I have chaffed them so much that they would never have let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh, because I know that I will be even with them in the long run.   What is it then?  I asked.  Oh, I don t mind telling a story against myself. That creature had gone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being footsore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a fourwheeler which was passing. I managed to be close to her so as to hear the address, but I need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud enough to be heard at the other side of the street,  Drive to 13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch,  she cried. This begins to look genuine, I thought, and having seen her safely inside, I perched myself behind. That s an art which every detective should be an expert at. Well, away we rattled, and never drew rein until we reached the street in question. I hopped off before we came to the door, and strolled down the street in an easy, lounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver jumped down, and I saw him open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing came out though. When I reached him he was groping about frantically in the empty cab, and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever I listened to. There was no sign or trace of his passenger, and I fear it will be some time before he gets his fare. On inquiring at Number 13 we found that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger, named Keswick, and that no one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there.   You don t mean to say,  I cried, in amazement,  that that tottering, feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion, without either you or the driver seeing her?   Old woman be damned!  said Sherlock Holmes, sharply.  We were the old women to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an active one, too, besides being an incomparable actor. The getup was inimitable. He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this means of giving me the slip. It shows that the man we are after is not as lonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who are ready to risk something for him. Now, Doctor, you are looking doneup. Take my advice and turn in.  I was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. I left Holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the watches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his violin, and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he had set himself to unravel. CHAPTER VI. TOBIAS GREGSON SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO. The papers next day were full of the  Brixton Mystery,  as they termed it. Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it in addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I still retain in my scrapbook numerous clippings and extracts bearing upon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them  The _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German name of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister inscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political refugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in America, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten laws, and been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff Highway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England. The _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from the unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening of all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had been residing for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the boardinghouse of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell. He was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th inst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of catching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together upon the platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber s body was, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road, many miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are questions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the whereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and Mr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it is confidently anticipated that these wellknown officers will speedily throw light upon the matter. The _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being a political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated the Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores a number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not soured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these men there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was punished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary, Stangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the deceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address of the house at which he had boarded a result which was entirely due to the acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard. Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and they appeared to afford him considerable amusement.  I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure to score.   That depends on how it turns out.   Oh, bless you, it doesn t matter in the least. If the man is caught, it will be _on account_ of their exertions if he escapes, it will be _in spite_ of their exertions. It s heads I win and tails you lose. Whatever they do, they will have followers.  Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l admire.   What on earth is this?  I cried, for at this moment there came the pattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by audible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.  It s the Baker Street division of the detective police force,  said my companion, gravely and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a dozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped eyes on.  Tention!  cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little scoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes.  In future you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you must wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?   No, sir, we hain t,  said one of the youths.  I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are your wages.  He handed each of them a shilling.  Now, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.  He waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats, and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.  There s more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than out of a dozen of the force,  Holmes remarked.  The mere sight of an officiallooking person seals men s lips. These youngsters, however, go everywhere and hear everything. They are as sharp as needles, too all they want is organisation.   Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?  I asked.  Yes there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matter of time. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance! Here is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every feature of his face. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There he is!  There was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the fairhaired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and burst into our sittingroom.  My dear fellow,  he cried, wringing Holmes  unresponsive hand,  congratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day.  A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion s expressive face.  Do you mean that you are on the right track?  he asked.  The right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.   And his name is?   Arthur Charpentier, sublieutenant in Her Majesty s navy,  cried Gregson, pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest. Sherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile.  Take a seat, and try one of these cigars,  he said.  We are anxious to know how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?   I don t mind if I do,  the detective answered.  The tremendous exertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain upon the mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both brainworkers.   You do me too much honour,  said Holmes, gravely.  Let us hear how you arrived at this most gratifying result.  The detective seated himself in the armchair, and puffed complacently at his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of amusement.  The fun of it is,  he cried,  that that fool Lestrade, who thinks himself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is after the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this time.  The idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.  And how did you get your clue?   Ah, I ll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is strictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to contend with was the finding of this American s antecedents. Some people would have waited until their advertisements were answered, or until parties came forward and volunteered information. That is not Tobias Gregson s way of going to work. You remember the hat beside the dead man?   Yes,  said Holmes  by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.  Gregson looked quite crestfallen.  I had no idea that you noticed that,  he said.  Have you been there?   No.   Ha!  cried Gregson, in a relieved voice  you should never neglect a chance, however small it may seem.   To a great mind, nothing is little,  remarked Holmes, sententiously.  Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that size and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once. He had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier s Boarding Establishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address.   Smart very smart!  murmured Sherlock Holmes.  I next called upon Madame Charpentier,  continued the detective.  I found her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room, too an uncommonly fine girl she is, too she was looking red about the eyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. That didn t escape my notice. I began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, when you come upon the right scent a kind of thrill in your nerves.  Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder Mr. Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?  I asked.  The mother nodded. She didn t seem able to get out a word. The daughter burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter.  At what o clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?  I asked.  At eight o clock,  she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her agitation.  His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two trains one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first.   And was that the last which you saw of him?   A terrible change came over the woman s face as I asked the question. Her features turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she could get out the single word  Yes and when it did come it was in a husky unnatural tone.  There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm clear voice.  No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,  she said.  Let us be frank with this gentleman. We _did_ see Mr. Drebber again.   God forgive you!  cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and sinking back in her chair.  You have murdered your brother.   Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,  the girl answered firmly.  You had best tell me all about it now,  I said.  Halfconfidences are worse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.   On your head be it, Alice!  cried her mother and then, turning to me,  I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be compromised. That however is surely impossible. His high character, his profession, his antecedents would all forbid it.   Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,  I answered.  Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.   Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,  she said, and her daughter withdrew.  Now, sir,  she continued,  I had no intention of telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all without omitting any particular.   It is your wisest course,  said I.  Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his secretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I noticed a  Copenhagen  label upon each of their trunks, showing that that had been their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet reserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise. He was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. The very night of his arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after twelve o clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober. His manners towards the maidservants were disgustingly free and familiar. Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way which, fortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one occasion he actually seized her in his arms and embraced her an outrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct.   But why did you stand all this,  I asked.  I suppose that you can get rid of your boarders when you wish.   Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question.  Would to God that I had given him notice on the very day that he came,  she said.  But it was a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each fourteen pounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy in the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for the best. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to leave on account of it. That was the reason of his going.   Well?   My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave just now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper is violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed the door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in less than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr. Drebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the worse for drink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to her that she should fly with him.  You are of age,  he said,  and there is no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the old girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live like a princess.  Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head. When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with a stick in his hand.  I don t think that fine fellow will trouble us again,  he said.  I will just go after him and see what he does with himself.  With those words he took his hat and started off down the street. The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber s mysterious death.   This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier s lips with many gasps and pauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words. I made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there should be no possibility of a mistake.   It s quite exciting,  said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn.  What happened next?   When Mrs. Charpentier paused,  the detective continued,  I saw that the whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way which I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her son returned.  I do not know,  she answered.  Not know?   No he has a latchkey, and he let himself in.   After you went to bed?   Yes.   When did you go to bed?   About eleven.   So your son was gone at least two hours?   Yes.   Possibly four or five?   Yes.   What was he doing during that time?   I do not know,  she answered, turning white to her very lips.  Of course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found out where Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and arrested him. When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass,  I suppose you are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel Drebber,  he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that his alluding to it had a most suspicious aspect.   Very,  said Holmes.  He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as having with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.   What is your theory, then?   Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road. When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course of which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach, perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night was so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and the writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent.   Well done!  said Holmes in an encouraging voice.  Really, Gregson, you are getting along. We shall make something of you yet.   I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,  the detective answered proudly.  The young man volunteered a statement, in which he said that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him, and took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an old shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this old shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. I think the whole case fits together uncommonly well. What amuses me is to think of Lestrade, who had started off upon the wrong scent. I am afraid he won t make much of it. Why, by Jove, here s the very man himself!  It was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were talking, and who now entered the room. The assurance and jauntiness which generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however, wanting. His face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged and untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of consulting with Sherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be embarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the room, fumbling nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do.  This is a most extraordinary case,  he said at last a most incomprehensible affair.   Ah, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade!  cried Gregson, triumphantly.  I thought you would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find the Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson?   The Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson,  said Lestrade gravely,  was murdered at Halliday s Private Hotel about six o clock this morning.  CHAPTER VII. LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS. The intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so unexpected, that we were all three fairly dumfoundered. Gregson sprang out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. I stared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes.  Stangerson too!  he muttered.  The plot thickens.   It was quite thick enough before,  grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair.  I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.   Are you are you sure of this piece of intelligence?  stammered Gregson.  I have just come from his room,  said Lestrade.  I was the first to discover what had occurred.   We have been hearing Gregson s view of the matter,  Holmes observed.  Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?   I have no objection,  Lestrade answered, seating himself.  I freely confess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the death of Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was completely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out what had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston Station about halfpast eight on the evening of the third. At two in the morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodginghouses in the vicinity of Euston. You see, I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated, the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the station again next morning.   They would be likely to agree on some meetingplace beforehand,  remarked Holmes.  So it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making enquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and at eight o clock I reached Halliday s Private Hotel, in Little George Street. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there, they at once answered me in the affirmative.  No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,  they said.  He has been waiting for a gentleman for two days.   Where is he now?  I asked.  He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.   I will go up and see him at once,  I said.  It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me the room it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor leading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about to go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish, in spite of my twenty years  experience. From under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side. I gave a cry, which brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he saw it. The door was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked it in. The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was quite dead, and had been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold. When we turned him over, the Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated the heart. And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man?  I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror, even before Sherlock Holmes answered.  The word RACHE, written in letters of blood,  he said.  That was it,  said Lestrade, in an awestruck voice and we were all silent for a while. There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle tingled as I thought of it.  The man was seen,  continued Lestrade.  A milk boy, passing on his way to the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay there, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which was wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular notice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a reddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder, for we found bloodstained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.  I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which tallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his face.  Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer?  he asked.  Nothing. Stangerson had Drebber s purse in his pocket, but it seems that this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd pounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. There were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man s pocket, except a single telegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the words,  J. H. is in Europe.  There was no name appended to this message.   And there was nothing else?  Holmes asked.  Nothing of any importance. The man s novel, with which he had read himself to sleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair beside him. There was a glass of water on the table, and on the windowsill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.  Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.  The last link,  he cried, exultantly.  My case is complete.  The two detectives stared at him in amazement.  I have now in my hands,  my companion said, confidently,  all the threads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, details to be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the time that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to the discovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own eyes. I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand upon those pills?   I have them,  said Lestrade, producing a small white box  I took them and the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place of safety at the Police Station. It was the merest chance my taking these pills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance to them.   Give them here,  said Holmes.  Now, Doctor,  turning to me,  are those ordinary pills?  They certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small, round, and almost transparent against the light.  From their lightness and transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,  I remarked.  Precisely so,  answered Holmes.  Now would you mind going down and fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long, and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday.  I went downstairs and carried the dog upstairs in my arms. Its laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end. Indeed, its snowwhite muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the rug.  I will now cut one of these pills in two,  said Holmes, and drawing his penknife he suited the action to the word.  One half we return into the box for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine glass, in which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our friend, the Doctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.   This may be very interesting,  said Lestrade, in the injured tone of one who suspects that he is being laughed at,  I cannot see, however, what it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.   Patience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has everything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps it up readily enough.  As he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock Holmes  earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling effect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretched upon the cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught. Holmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without result, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the table, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great was his emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two detectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check which he had met.  It can t be a coincidence,  he cried, at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room  it is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the case of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson. And yet they are inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible! And yet this wretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it! I have it!  With a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, cut the other pill in two, dissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the terrier. The unfortunate creature s tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning. Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his forehead.  I should have more faith,  he said  I ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation. Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that before ever I saw the box at all.  This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog, however, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began to have a dim, vague perception of the truth.  All this seems strange to you,  continued Holmes,  because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence of it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions. It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those _outr _ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more difficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.  Mr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable impatience, could contain himself no longer.  Look here, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,  he said,  we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart man, and that you have your own methods of working. We want something more than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a case of taking the man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. Young Charpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. Lestrade went after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too. You have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more than we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business. Can you name the man who did it?   I cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,  remarked Lestrade.  We have both tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked more than once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require. Surely you will not withhold it any longer.   Any delay in arresting the assassin,  I observed,  might give him time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity.  Thus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought.  There will be no more murders,  he said at last, stopping abruptly and facing us.  You can put that consideration out of the question. You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere knowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the power of laying our hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do. I have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements but it is a thing which needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by another who is as clever as himself. As long as this man has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him but if he had the slightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city. Without meaning to hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that I consider these men to be more than a match for the official force, and that is why I have not asked your assistance. If I fail I shall, of course, incur all the blame due to this omission but that I am prepared for. At present I am ready to promise that the instant that I can communicate with you without endangering my own combinations, I shall do so.  Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance, or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police. The former had flushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the other s beady eyes glistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither of them had time to speak, however, before there was a tap at the door, and the spokesman of the street Arabs, young Wiggins, introduced his insignificant and unsavoury person.  Please, sir,  he said, touching his forelock,  I have the cab downstairs.   Good boy,  said Holmes, blandly.  Why don t you introduce this pattern at Scotland Yard?  he continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs from a drawer.  See how beautifully the spring works. They fasten in an instant.   The old pattern is good enough,  remarked Lestrade,  if we can only find the man to put them on.   Very good, very good,  said Holmes, smiling.  The cabman may as well help me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.  I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about to set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it. There was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out and began to strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the room.  Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,  he said, kneeling over his task, and never turning his head. The fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put down his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click, the jangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.  Gentlemen,  he cried, with flashing eyes,  let me introduce you to Mr. Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson.  The whole thing occurred in a moment so quickly that I had no time to realize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes  triumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman s dazed, savage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a second or two we might have been a group of statues. Then, with an inarticulate roar of fury, the prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes s grasp, and hurled himself through the window. Woodwork and glass gave way before him but before he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds. He was dragged back into the room, and then commenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he, that the four of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. His face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass, but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. It was not until Lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and halfstrangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless and panting.  We have his cab,  said Sherlock Holmes.  It will serve to take him to Scotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,  he continued, with a pleasant smile,  we have reached the end of our little mystery. You are very welcome to put any questions that you like to me now, and there is no danger that I will refuse to answer them.  PART II. _The Country of the Saints._ CHAPTER I. ON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN. In the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a barrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises snowcapped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are swiftflowing rivers which dash through jagged ca ons and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the common characteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery. There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees or of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other huntinggrounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight of those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their prairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily through the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness. In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plainland, all dusted over with patches of alkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks, with their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch of country there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life. There is no bird in the steelblue heaven, no movement upon the dull, grey earth above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness nothing but silence complete and heartsubduing silence. It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones some large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside. Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May, eighteen hundred and fortyseven, a solitary traveller. His appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region. An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the brown parchmentlike skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones his long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white his eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his clothes, which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man was dying dying from hunger and from thirst. He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little elevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the great salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might indicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there was no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild questioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die.  Why not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,  he muttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder. Before sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle, and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had carried slung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground with some little violence. Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face, with very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists.  You ve hurt me!  said a childish voice reproachfully.  Have I though,  the man answered penitently,  I didn t go for to do it.  As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty little girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart pink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother s care. The child was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered less than her companion.  How is it now?  he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the towsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.  Kiss it and make it well,  she said, with perfect gravity, showing the injured part up to him.  That s what mother used to do. Where s mother?   Mother s gone. I guess you ll see her before long.   Gone, eh!  said the little girl.  Funny, she didn t say goodbye she  most always did if she was just goin  over to Auntie s for tea, and now she s been away three days. Say, it s awful dry, ain t it? Ain t there no water, nor nothing to eat?   No, there ain t nothing, dearie. You ll just need to be patient awhile, and then you ll be all right. Put your head up agin me like that, and then you ll feel bullier. It ain t easy to talk when your lips is like leather, but I guess I d best let you know how the cards lie. What s that you ve got?   Pretty things! fine things!  cried the little girl enthusiastically, holding up two glittering fragments of mica.  When we goes back to home I ll give them to brother Bob.   You ll see prettier things than them soon,  said the man confidently.  You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you though you remember when we left the river?   Oh, yes.   Well, we reckoned we d strike another river soon, d ye see. But there was somethin  wrong compasses, or map, or somethin , and it didn t turn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of you and and   And you couldn t wash yourself,  interrupted his companion gravely, staring up at his grimy visage.  No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian Pete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie, your mother.   Then mother s a deader too,  cried the little girl dropping her face in her pinafore and sobbing bitterly.  Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some chance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it together. It don t seem as though we ve improved matters. There s an almighty small chance for us now!   Do you mean that we are going to die too?  asked the child, checking her sobs, and raising her tearstained face.  I guess that s about the size of it.   Why didn t you say so before?  she said, laughing gleefully.  You gave me such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we ll be with mother again.   Yes, you will, dearie.   And you too. I ll tell her how awful good you ve been. I ll bet she meets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot of buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was fond of. How long will it be first?   I don t know not very long.  The man s eyes were fixed upon the northern horizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly did they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards, the vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death.  Cocks and hens,  cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their illomened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise.  Say, did God make this country?   In course He did,  said her companion, rather startled by this unexpected question.  He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,  the little girl continued.  I guess somebody else made the country in these parts. It s not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the trees.   What would ye think of offering up prayer?  the man asked diffidently.  It ain t night yet,  she answered.  It don t matter. It ain t quite regular, but He won t mind that, you bet. You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the waggon when we was on the Plains.   Why don t you say some yourself?  the child asked, with wondering eyes.  I disremember them,  he answered.  I hain t said none since I was half the height o  that gun. I guess it s never too late. You say them out, and I ll stand by and come in on the choruses.   Then you ll need to kneel down, and me too,  she said, laying the shawl out for that purpose.  You ve got to put your hands up like this. It makes you feel kind o  good.  It was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see it. Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the little prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her chubby face, and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom they were face to face, while the two voices the one thin and clear, the other deep and harsh united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness. The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad breast of her protector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids drooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the man s grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion, and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber. Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight would have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid, welldefined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds. As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvascovered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze, and the apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West. But what a caravan! When the head of it had reached the base of the mountains, the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Right across the enormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggons and carts, men on horseback, and men on foot. Innumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings. This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new country. There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above them. At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced men, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On reaching the base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council among themselves.  The wells are to the right, my brothers,  said one, a hardlipped, cleanshaven man with grizzly hair.  To the right of the Sierra Blanco so we shall reach the Rio Grande,  said another.  Fear not for water,  cried a third.  He who could draw it from the rocks will not now abandon His own chosen people.   Amen! Amen!  responded the whole party. They were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and keenesteyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag above them. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink, showing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight there was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while fresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word  Redskins  was on every lip.  There can t be any number of Injuns here,  said the elderly man who appeared to be in command.  We have passed the Pawnees, and there are no other tribes until we cross the great mountains.   Shall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,  asked one of the band.  And I,   and I,  cried a dozen voices.  Leave your horses below and we will await you here,  the Elder answered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their horses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object which had excited their curiosity. They advanced rapidly and noiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts. The watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the skyline. The young man who had first given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his followers saw him throw up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and on joining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met their eyes. On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man, longbearded and hardfeatured, but of an excessive thinness. His placid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep. Beside him lay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his brown sinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast of his velveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular line of snowwhite teeth within, and a playful smile played over her infantile features. Her plump little white legs terminating in white socks and neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast to the long shrivelled members of her companion. On the ledge of rock above this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight of the new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away. The cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about them in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down upon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him, and which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts. His face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he passed his boney hand over his eyes.  This is what they call delirium, I guess,  he muttered. The child stood beside him, holding on to the skirt of his coat, and said nothing but looked all round her with the wondering questioning gaze of childhood. The rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that their appearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little girl, and hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her gaunt companion, and assisted him towards the waggons.  My name is John Ferrier,  the wanderer explained  me and that little un are all that s left o  twentyone people. The rest is all dead o  thirst and hunger away down in the south.   Is she your child?  asked someone.  I guess she is now,  the other cried, defiantly  she s mine  cause I saved her. No man will take her from me. She s Lucy Ferrier from this day on. Who are you, though?  he continued, glancing with curiosity at his stalwart, sunburned rescuers  there seems to be a powerful lot of ye.   Nigh upon ten thousand,  said one of the young men  we are the persecuted children of God the chosen of the Angel Merona.   I never heard tell on him,  said the wanderer.  He appears to have chosen a fair crowd of ye.   Do not jest at that which is sacred,  said the other sternly.  We are of those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian letters on plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy Joseph Smith at Palmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of Illinois, where we had founded our temple. We have come to seek a refuge from the violent man and from the godless, even though it be the heart of the desert.  The name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier.  I see,  he said,  you are the Mormons.   We are the Mormons,  answered his companions with one voice.  And where are you going?   We do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of our Prophet. You must come before him. He shall say what is to be done with you.  They had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surrounded by crowds of the pilgrims palefaced meeklooking women, strong laughing children, and anxious earnesteyed men. Many were the cries of astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they perceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the other. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by a great crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was conspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of its appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were furnished with two, or, at most, four apiece. Beside the driver there sat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but whose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader. He was reading a brownbacked volume, but as the crowd approached he laid it aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode. Then he turned to the two castaways.  If we take you with us,  he said, in solemn words,  it can only be as believers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the whole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms?   Guess I ll come with you on any terms,  said Ferrier, with such emphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader alone retained his stern, impressive expression.  Take him, Brother Stangerson,  he said,  give him food and drink, and the child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!   On, on to Zion!  cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled down the long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a dull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a creaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon the whole caravan was winding along once more. The Elder to whose care the two waifs had been committed, led them to his waggon, where a meal was already awaiting them.  You shall remain here,  he said.  In a few days you will have recovered from your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and for ever you are of our religion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has spoken with the voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God.  CHAPTER II. THE FLOWER OF UTAH. This is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured by the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From the shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history. The savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and disease every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had all been overcome with AngloSaxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and the accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them. There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the promised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for evermore. Young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a resolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the future city was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and allotted in proportion to the standing of each individual. The tradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the town streets and squares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country there was draining and hedging, planting and clearing, until the next summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop. Everything prospered in the strange settlement. Above all, the great temple which they had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger. From the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight, the clatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the immigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers. The two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson s waggon, a retreat which she shared with the Mormon s three wives and with his son, a headstrong forward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of childhood, from the shock caused by her mother s death, she soon became a pet with the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvascovered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal Elders. On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial loghouse, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen in his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution enabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his lands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his neighbours, in six he was welltodo, in nine he was rich, and in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who could compare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch Mountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier. There was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities of his coreligionists. No argument or persuasion could ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions. He never gave reasons for this persistent refusal, but contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination. There were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion, and others who put it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense. Others, again, spoke of some early love affair, and of a fairhaired girl who had pined away on the shores of the Atlantic. Whatever the reason, Ferrier remained strictly celibate. In every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being an orthodox and straightwalking man. Lucy Ferrier grew up within the loghouse, and assisted her adopted father in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the balsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to the young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger, her cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by Ferrier s farm felt longforgotten thoughts revive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father s mustang, and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West. So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her father the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope. It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had developed into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious change is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns, with a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has awoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and remember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life. In the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself, apart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides. It was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavilyladen mules, all heading to the west, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the Overland Route lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands, and trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy Ferrier, her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her. She had a commission from her father in the City, and was dashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed. The travelstained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and even the unemotional Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the palefaced maiden. She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a halfdozen wildlooking herdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap. Scarcely had she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed in behind her, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of fierceeyed, longhorned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to deal with cattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took advantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way through the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider. The situation was full of peril. Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns again, and goaded it to fresh madness. It was all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals. Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her head began to swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax. Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she might have abandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance. At the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts.  You re not hurt, I hope, miss,  said her preserver, respectfully. She looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily.  I m awful frightened,  she said, naively  whoever would have thought that Poncho would have been so scared by a lot of cows?   Thank God you kept your seat,  the other said earnestly. He was a tall, savagelooking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse, and clad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over his shoulders.  I guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,  he remarked,  I saw you ride down from his house. When you see him, ask him if he remembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis. If he s the same Ferrier, my father and he were pretty thick.   Hadn t you better come and ask yourself?  she asked, demurely. The young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure.  I ll do so,  he said,  we ve been in the mountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting condition. He must take us as he finds us.   He has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,  she answered,  he s awful fond of me. If those cows had jumped on me he d have never got over it.   Neither would I,  said her companion.  You! Well, I don t see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow. You ain t even a friend of ours.  The young hunter s dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy Ferrier laughed aloud.  There, I didn t mean that,  she said  of course, you are a friend now. You must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won t trust me with his business any more. Goodbye!   Goodbye,  he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over her little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her ridingwhip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of dust. Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn. He and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver, and were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital enough to work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as keen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn his thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young girl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his volcanic, untamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished from his sight, he realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that neither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to him as this new and allabsorbing one. The love which had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather the wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper. He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook. He swore in his heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human perseverance could render him successful. He called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until his face was a familiar one at the farmhouse. John, cooped up in the valley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning the news of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this Jefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested Lucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in those wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a silver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to be had, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became a favourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. On such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright, happy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer her own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms, but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her affections. It was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled up at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He threw the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.  I am off, Lucy,  he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing tenderly down into her face  I won t ask you to come with me now, but will you be ready to come when I am here again?   And when will that be?  she asked, blushing and laughing.  A couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then, my darling. There s no one who can stand between us.   And how about father?  she asked.  He has given his consent, provided we get these mines working all right. I have no fear on that head.   Oh, well of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there s no more to be said,  she whispered, with her cheek against his broad breast.  Thank God!  he said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her.  It is settled, then. The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They are waiting for me at the ca on. Goodbye, my own darling goodbye. In two months you shall see me.  He tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his horse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though afraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what he was leaving. She stood at the gate, gazing after him until he vanished from her sight. Then she walked back into the house, the happiest girl in all Utah. CHAPTER III. JOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET. Three weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had departed from Salt Lake City. John Ferrier s heart was sore within him when he thought of the young man s return, and of the impending loss of his adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always determined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he regarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever he might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was inflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in the Land of the Saints. Yes, a dangerous matter so dangerous that even the most saintly dared only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something which fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a swift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turned persecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most terrible description. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German Vehmgericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over the State of Utah. Its invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this organization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out against the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or what had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home, but no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands of his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed by annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this terrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men went about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them. At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the recalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards to pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The supply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female population on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange rumours began to be bandied about rumours of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women appeared in the harems of the Elders women who pined and wept, and bore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated wanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked, stealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. These tales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and recorroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name. To this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite Band, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an illomened one. Fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible results served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it inspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless society. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret. The very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the Prophet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence every man feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were nearest his heart. One fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields, when he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window, saw a stout, sandyhaired, middleaged man coming up the pathway. His heart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great Brigham Young himself. Full of trepidation for he knew that such a visit boded him little good Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief. The latter, however, received his salutations coldly, and followed him with a stern face into the sittingroom.  Brother Ferrier,  he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly from under his lightcoloured eyelashes,  the true believers have been good friends to you. We picked you up when you were starving in the desert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley, gave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our protection. Is not this so?   It is so,  answered John Ferrier.  In return for all this we asked but one condition that was, that you should embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages. This you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you have neglected.   And how have I neglected it?  asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in expostulation.  Have I not given to the common fund? Have I not attended at the Temple? Have I not ?   Where are your wives?  asked Young, looking round him.  Call them in, that I may greet them.   It is true that I have not married,  Ferrier answered.  But women were few, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a lonely man I had my daughter to attend to my wants.   It is of that daughter that I would speak to you,  said the leader of the Mormons.  She has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land.  John Ferrier groaned internally.  There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve stories that she is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues. What is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith?  Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect for if she wed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.  This being so, it is impossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your daughter to violate it.  John Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his ridingwhip.  Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested so it has been decided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would not have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all choice. We Elders have many heifers,1 but our children must also be provided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choose between them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say you to that?  1 Heber C. Kemball, in one of his sermons, alludes to his hundred wives under this endearing epithet. Ferrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.  You will give us time,  he said at last.  My daughter is very young she is scarce of an age to marry.   She shall have a month to choose,  said Young, rising from his seat.  At the end of that time she shall give her answer.  He was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face and flashing eyes.  It were better for you, John Ferrier,  he thundered,  that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra Blanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of the Holy Four!  With a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and Ferrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path. He was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he should broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon his, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her pale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed.  I could not help it,  she said, in answer to his look.  His voice rang through the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?   Don t you scare yourself,  he answered, drawing her to him, and passing his broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair.  We ll fix it up somehow or another. You don t find your fancy kind o  lessening for this chap, do you?  A sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer.  No of course not. I shouldn t care to hear you say you did. He s a likely lad, and he s a Christian, which is more than these folk here, in spite o  all their praying and preaching. There s a party starting for Nevada tomorrow, and I ll manage to send him a message letting him know the hole we are in. If I know anything o  that young man, he ll be back here with a speed that would whip electrotelegraphs.  Lucy laughed through her tears at her father s description.  When he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you that I am frightened, dear. One hears one hears such dreadful stories about those who oppose the Prophet something terrible always happens to them.   But we haven t opposed him yet,  her father answered.  It will be time to look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us at the end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.   Leave Utah!   That s about the size of it.   But the farm?   We will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell the truth, Lucy, it isn t the first time I have thought of doing it. I don t care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their darned prophet. I m a freeborn American, and it s all new to me. Guess I m too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this farm, he might chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite direction.   But they won t let us leave,  his daughter objected.  Wait till Jefferson comes, and we ll soon manage that. In the meantime, don t you fret yourself, my dearie, and don t get your eyes swelled up, else he ll be walking into me when he sees you. There s nothing to be afeared about, and there s no danger at all.  John Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone, but she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the fastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom. CHAPTER IV. A FLIGHT FOR LIFE. On the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet, John Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his acquaintance, who was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted him with his message to Jefferson Hope. In it he told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he should return. Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and returned home with a lighter heart. As he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to each of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on entering to find two young men in possession of his sittingroom. One, with a long pale face, was leaning back in the rockingchair, with his feet cocked up upon the stove. The other, a bullnecked youth with coarse bloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands in his pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both of them nodded to Ferrier as he entered, and the one in the rockingchair commenced the conversation.  Maybe you don t know us,  he said.  This here is the son of Elder Drebber, and I m Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true fold.   As He will all the nations in His own good time,  said the other in a nasal voice  He grindeth slowly but exceeding small.  John Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.  We have come,  continued Stangerson,  at the advice of our fathers to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has seven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.   Nay, nay, Brother Stangerson,  cried the other  the question is not how many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now given over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.   But my prospects are better,  said the other, warmly.  When the Lord removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.   It will be for the maiden to decide,  rejoined young Drebber, smirking at his own reflection in the glass.  We will leave it all to her decision.  During this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway, hardly able to keep his ridingwhip from the backs of his two visitors.  Look here,  he said at last, striding up to them,  when my daughter summons you, you can come, but until then I don t want to see your faces again.  The two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this competition between them for the maiden s hand was the highest of honours both to her and her father.  There are two ways out of the room,  cried Ferrier  there is the door, and there is the window. Which do you care to use?  His brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening, that his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. The old farmer followed them to the door.  Let me know when you have settled which it is to be,  he said, sardonically.  You shall smart for this!  Stangerson cried, white with rage.  You have defied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to the end of your days.   The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,  cried young Drebber  He will arise and smite you!   Then I ll start the smiting,  exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would have rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and restrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses  hoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.  The young canting rascals!  he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from his forehead  I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the wife of either of them.   And so should I, father,  she answered, with spirit  but Jefferson will soon be here.   Yes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for we do not know what their next move may be.  It was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted daughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been such a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If minor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this arch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no avail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been spirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He was a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which hung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but this suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease. He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from Young as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an unlookedfor manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his surprise, a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters   Twentynine days are given you for amendment, and then  The dash was more fearinspiring than any threat could have been. How this warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his servants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been secured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but the incident struck a chill into his heart. The twentynine days were evidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. What strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such mysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck him to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him. Still more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their breakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the centre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the number 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not enlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27 had been painted upon the outside of his door. Thus day followed day and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls, sometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John Ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada. Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news of the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there came no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a driver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking that help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to four and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of escape. Singlehanded, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The morefrequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could pass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he would, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him. Yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter s dishonour. He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, and searching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown the figure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the last of the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague and terrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter what was to become of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the invisible network which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon the table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence. What was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound low, but very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of the house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was repeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open. Outside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were twinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the farmer s eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on the road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier looked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at his own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face upon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl. So unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying man, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within the house the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson Hope.  Good God!  gasped John Ferrier.  How you scared me! Whatever made you come in like that.   Give me food,  the other said, hoarsely.  I have had no time for bite or sup for eightandforty hours.  He flung himself upon the cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host s supper, and devoured it voraciously.  Does Lucy bear up well?  he asked, when he had satisfied his hunger.  Yes. She does not know the danger,  her father answered.  That is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I crawled my way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they re not quite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter.  John Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a devoted ally. He seized the young man s leathery hand and wrung it cordially.  You re a man to be proud of,  he said.  There are not many who would come to share our danger and our troubles.   You ve hit it there, pard,  the young hunter answered.  I have a respect for you, but if you were alone in this business I d think twice before I put my head into such a hornet s nest. It s Lucy that brings me here, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o  the Hope family in Utah.   What are we to do?   Tomorrow is your last day, and unless you act tonight you are lost. I have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much money have you?   Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.   That will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for Carson City through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as well that the servants do not sleep in the house.  While Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching journey, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into a small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by experience that the mountain wells were few and far between. He had hardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his daughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between the lovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was much to be done.  We must make our start at once,  said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a low but resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the peril, but has steeled his heart to meet it.  The front and back entrances are watched, but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the fields. Once on the road we are only two miles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we should be halfway through the mountains.   What if we are stopped,  asked Ferrier. Hope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his tunic.  If they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them with us,  he said with a sinister smile. The lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the darkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own, and which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved himself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes. All looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grainland, that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head. Ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scanty provisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and carefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. With bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained the shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow, where they lay silent and trembling. It was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the ears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the melancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of them, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small distance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal cry again, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity.  Tomorrow at midnight,  said the first who appeared to be in authority.  When the WhippoorWill calls three times.   It is well,  returned the other.  Shall I tell Brother Drebber?   Pass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven!   Seven to five!  repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away in different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some form of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died away in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping his companions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the top of his speed, supporting and halfcarrying the girl when her strength appeared to fail her.  Hurry on! hurry on!  he gasped from time to time.  We are through the line of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!  Once on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they meet anyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid recognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged peaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led between them was the Eagle Ca on in which the horses were awaiting them. With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great boulders and along the bed of a driedup watercourse, until he came to the retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful animals had been picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old Ferrier upon one of the horses, with his moneybag, while Jefferson Hope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path. It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face Nature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a thousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic columns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster. On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance impossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow in places that they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that only practised riders could have traversed it at all. Yet in spite of all dangers and difficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light within them, for every step increased the distance between them and the terrible despotism from which they were flying. They soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the jurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most desolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and pointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark and plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them as soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of  Who goes there?  rang through the silent ravine.  Travellers for Nevada,  said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the rifle which hung by his saddle. They could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down at them as if dissatisfied at their reply.  By whose permission?  he asked.  The Holy Four,  answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught him that that was the highest authority to which he could refer.  Nine from seven,  cried the sentinel.  Seven from five,  returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the countersign which he had heard in the garden.  Pass, and the Lord go with you,  said the voice from above. Beyond his post the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a trot. Looking back, they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon his gun, and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen people, and that freedom lay before them. CHAPTER V. THE AVENGING ANGELS. All night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular and rockstrewn paths. More than once they lost their way, but Hope s intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them. In every direction the great snowcapped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each other s shoulders to the far horizon. So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear entirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they passed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a gallop. As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great mountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until they were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her father would fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable.  They will be upon our track by this time,  he said.  Everything depends upon our speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for the remainder of our lives.  During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their enemies. At nighttime they chose the base of a beetling crag, where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there huddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours  sleep. Before daybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had seen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could reach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them. About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness, however, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had frequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life. Choosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air was bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animals stood motionless in the background. Then the intervening rocks hid them from his view. He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity. At last, after two or three hours  fruitless search, he was thinking of turning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic horns. The bighorn for so it is called was acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The animal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath. The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy over his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening was already drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he realized the difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had wandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in which he found himself divided and subdivided into many gorges, which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other. He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey. He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously, for he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen reecho to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an answer. None came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary silent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation. When he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead silence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to convictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the remains of the fire animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no traces behind it. Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He was essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence. Seizing a halfconsumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help to examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet of horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of his companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side of the camp was a lowlying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly not been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything but a newlydug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point JOHN FERRIER, FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY, Died August 4th, 1860. The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone, then, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round to see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder s son. As the young fellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to prevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in his last silent restingplace. Again, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs from despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least devote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance, Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived. As he stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution, brought by his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring energy should, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim, white face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a few days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the avenging angels. For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down among the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep but before daybreak he was always well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle Ca on, from which they had commenced their illfated flight. Thence he could look down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of festivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse s hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding towards him. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named Cowper, to whom he had rendered services at different times. He therefore accosted him when he got up to him, with the object of finding out what Lucy Ferrier s fate had been.  I am Jefferson Hope,  he said.  You remember me.  The Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment indeed, it was difficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly white face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former days. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity, the man s surprise changed to consternation.  You are mad to come here,  he cried.  It is as much as my own life is worth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from the Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.   I don t fear them, or their warrant,  Hope said, earnestly.  You must know something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you hold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For God s sake, don t refuse to answer me.   What is it?  the Mormon asked uneasily.  Be quick. The very rocks have ears and the trees eyes.   What has become of Lucy Ferrier?   She was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you have no life left in you.   Don t mind me,  said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning.  Married, you say?   Married yesterday that s what those flags are for on the Endowment House. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson as to which was to have her. They d both been in the party that followed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the best claim but when they argued it out in council, Drebber s party was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one won t have her very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday. She is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then?   Yes, I am off,  said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. His face might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its expression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.  Where are you going?   Never mind,  he answered and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder, strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself. The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her head again, but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish husband, who had married her principally for the sake of John Ferrier s property, did not affect any great grief at his bereavement but his other wives mourned over her, and sat up with her the night before the burial, as is the Mormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and astonishment, the door was flung open, and a savagelooking, weatherbeaten man in tattered garments strode into the room. Without a glance or a word to the cowering women, he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching up her hand, he took the weddingring from her finger.  She shall not be buried in that,  he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. So strange and so brief was the episode, that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared. For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson s window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having their houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness. Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter s mind was of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any other emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soon realized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome food were wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains, what was to become of his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play his enemy s game, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there to recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation. His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that memorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier s grave. Disguised, and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to be justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger members of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the Elders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the malcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson and no one knew whither they had gone. Rumour reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his property into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. There was no clue at all, however, as to their whereabouts. Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of revenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never faltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked out by such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town through the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he had devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window, had recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in his eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by Stangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into custody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some weeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that Drebber s house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had departed for Europe. Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred urged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and for some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his approaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in him, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to city, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the fugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris and when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off for Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for they had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running them to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than quote the old hunter s own account, as duly recorded in Dr. Watson s Journal, to which we are already under such obligations. CHAPTER VI. A CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON, M.D. Our prisoner s furious resistance did not apparently indicate any ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself powerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes that he had not hurt any of us in the scuffle.  I guess you re going to take me to the policestation,  he remarked to Sherlock Holmes.  My cab s at the door. If you ll loose my legs I ll walk down to it. I m not so light to lift as I used to be.  Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this proposition rather a bold one but Holmes at once took the prisoner at his word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ankles. He rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself that they were free once more. I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed him, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was as formidable as his personal strength.  If there s a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you are the man for it,  he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my fellowlodger.  The way you kept on my trail was a caution.   You had better come with me,  said Holmes to the two detectives.  I can drive you,  said Lestrade.  Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us.  I assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made no attempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his, and we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse, and brought us in a very short time to our destination. We were ushered into a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner s name and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged. The official was a whitefaced unemotional man, who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way.  The prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week,  he said  in the mean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn you that your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.   I ve got a good deal to say,  our prisoner said slowly.  I want to tell you gentlemen all about it.   Hadn t you better reserve that for your trial?  asked the Inspector.  I may never be tried,  he answered.  You needn t look startled. It isn t suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?  He turned his fierce dark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.  Yes I am,  I answered.  Then put your hand here,  he said, with a smile, motioning with his manacled wrists towards his chest. I did so and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful engine was at work. In the silence of the room I could hear a dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source.  Why,  I cried,  you have an aortic aneurism!   That s what they call it,  he said, placidly.  I went to a Doctor last week about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before many days passed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from overexposure and underfeeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I ve done my work now, and I don t care how soon I go, but I should like to leave some account of the business behind me. I don t want to be remembered as a common cutthroat.  The Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the advisability of allowing him to tell his story.  Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?  the former asked.  Most certainly there is,  I answered.  In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to take his statement,  said the Inspector.  You are at liberty, sir, to give your account, which I again warn you will be taken down.   I ll sit down, with your leave,  the prisoner said, suiting the action to the word.  This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I m on the brink of the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I say is the absolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to me.  With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began the following remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical manner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough. I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had access to Lestrade s notebook, in which the prisoner s words were taken down exactly as they were uttered.  It don t much matter to you why I hated these men,  he said  it s enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings a father and a daughter and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own lives. After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. I knew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one. You d have done the same, if you have any manhood in you, if you had been in my place.  That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. She was forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart over it. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished. I have carried it about with me, and have followed him and his accomplice over two continents until I caught them. They thought to tire me out, but they could not do it. If I die tomorrow, as is likely enough, I die knowing that my work in this world is done, and well done. They have perished, and by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire.  They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I found that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner s office, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to the owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the mazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had a map beside me though, and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and stations, I got on pretty well.  It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them. They were at a boardinghouse at Camberwell, over on the other side of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at my mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their recognizing me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my opportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again.  They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about London, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they could not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or late at night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand with my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted.  They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone, and never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every day, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them late and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance but I was not discouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work undone.  At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the street was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to their door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time Drebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my horse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I feared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on to the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them. Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the matter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch what Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that he must not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday s Private Hotel to which Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven, and made his way out of the station.  The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my enemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue precipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and returned but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed. By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from interruption. How to get Drebber to that house was the difficult problem which I had now to solve.  He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying for nearly halfanhour in the last of them. When he came out he staggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a hansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets, until, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in which he had boarded. I could not imagine what his intention was in returning there but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from the house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away. Give me a glass of water, if you please. My mouth gets dry with the talking.  I handed him the glass, and he drank it down.  That s better,  he said.  Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or more, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen before. This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half across the road.  You hound,  he cried, shaking his stick at him  I ll teach you to insult an honest girl!  He was so hot that I think he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He ran as far as the corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and jumped in.  Drive me to Halliday s Private Hotel,  said he.  When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that I feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove along slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I might take him right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane have my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this, when he solved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again, and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leaving word that I should wait for him. There he remained until closing time, and when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my own hands.  Don t imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only have been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself to do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for his life if he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets which I have filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day the professor was lecturing on poisons, and he showed his students some alkaloid, as he called it, which he had extracted from some South American arrow poison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant death. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and when they were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a fairly good dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison. I determined at the time that when I had my chance, my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I ate the pill that remained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief. From that day I had always my pill boxes about with me, and the time had now come when I was to use them.  It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard and raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within so glad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty long years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would understand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my nerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with excitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I see you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on each side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road.  There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the dripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber all huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm,  It s time to get out,  I said.  All right, cabby,  said he.  I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned, for he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden. I had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little topheavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the front room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the daughter were walking in front of us.  It s infernally dark,  said he, stamping about.  We ll soon have a light,  I said, striking a match and putting it to a wax candle which I had brought with me.  Now, Enoch Drebber,  I continued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face,  who am I?   He gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which showed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I saw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered in his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and laughed loud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be sweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me.  You dog!  I said  I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St. Petersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your wanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see tomorrow s sun rise.  He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I could see on his face that he thought I was mad. So I was for the time. The pulses in my temples beat like sledgehammers, and I believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me.  What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?  I cried, locking the door, and shaking the key in his face.  Punishment has been slow in coming, but it has overtaken you at last.  I saw his coward lips tremble as I spoke. He would have begged for his life, but he knew well that it was useless.  Would you murder me?  he stammered.  There is no murder,  I answered.  Who talks of murdering a mad dog? What mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her slaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless harem.   It was not I who killed her father,  he cried.  But it was you who broke her innocent heart,  I shrieked, thrusting the box before him.  Let the high God judge between us. Choose and eat. There is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you leave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are ruled by chance.   He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I swallowed the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die. Shall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as I saw it, and held Lucy s marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was but for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm of pain contorted his features he threw his hands out in front of him, staggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I turned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There was no movement. He was dead!  The blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice of it. I don t know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police upon a wrong track, for I felt lighthearted and cheerful. I remembered a German being found in New York with RACHE written up above him, and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must have done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall. Then I walked down to my cab and found that there was nobody about, and that the night was still very wild. I had driven some distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which I usually kept Lucy s ring, and found that it was not there. I was thunderstruck at this, for it was the only memento that I had of her. Thinking that I might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber s body, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldly up to the house for I was ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into the arms of a policeofficer who was coming out, and only managed to disarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk.  That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was to do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier s debt. I knew that he was staying at Halliday s Private Hotel, and I hung about all day, but he never came out. I fancy that he suspected something when Drebber failed to put in an appearance. He was cunning, was Stangerson, and always on his guard. If he thought he could keep me off by staying indoors he was very much mistaken. I soon found out which was the window of his bedroom, and early next morning I took advantage of some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so made my way into his room in the grey of the dawn. I woke him up and told him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so long before. I described Drebber s death to him, and I gave him the same choice of the poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at the chance of safety which that offered him, he sprang from his bed and flew at my throat. In selfdefence I stabbed him to the heart. It would have been the same in any case, for Providence would never have allowed his guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison.  I have little more to say, and it s as well, for I am about done up. I went on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I could save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next thing I knew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and as neatly shackled as ever I saw in my life. That s the whole of my story, gentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer but I hold that I am just as much an officer of justice as you are.  So thrilling had the man s narrative been, and his manner was so impressive that we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professional detectives, _blas _ as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to be keenly interested in the man s story. When he finished we sat for some minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of Lestrade s pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand account.  There is only one point on which I should like a little more information,  Sherlock Holmes said at last.  Who was your accomplice who came for the ring which I advertised?  The prisoner winked at my friend jocosely.  I can tell my own secrets,  he said,  but I don t get other people into trouble. I saw your advertisement, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might be the ring which I wanted. My friend volunteered to go and see. I think you ll own he did it smartly.   Not a doubt of that,  said Holmes heartily.  Now, gentlemen,  the Inspector remarked gravely,  the forms of the law must be complied with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before the magistrates, and your attendance will be required. Until then I will be responsible for him.  He rang the bell as he spoke, and Jefferson Hope was led off by a couple of warders, while my friend and I made our way out of the Station and took a cab back to Baker Street. CHAPTER VII. THE CONCLUSION. We had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the Thursday but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our testimony. A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson Hope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would be meted out to him. On the very night after his capture the aneurism burst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the cell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been able in his dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work well done.  Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,  Holmes remarked, as we chatted it over next evening.  Where will their grand advertisement be now?   I don t see that they had very much to do with his capture,  I answered.  What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,  returned my companion, bitterly.  The question is, what can you make people believe that you have done. Never mind,  he continued, more brightly, after a pause.  I would not have missed the investigation for anything. There has been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there were several most instructive points about it.   Simple!  I ejaculated.  Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,  said Sherlock Holmes, smiling at my surprise.  The proof of its intrinsic simplicity is, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days.   That is true,  said I.  I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very useful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise it much. In the everyday affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.   I confess,  said I,  that I do not quite follow you.   I hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer. Most people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you what the result would be. They can put those events together in their minds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are few people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning backwards, or analytically.   I understand,  said I.  Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you the different steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I approached the house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely free from all impressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway, and there, as I have already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which, I ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during the night. I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman s brougham.  This was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden path, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable for taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps. Happily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice has made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the constables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been before the others, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them. In this way my second link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number, one remarkable for his height as I calculated from the length of his stride, and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots.  On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My wellbooted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder there was. There was no wound upon the dead man s person, but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or any sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their features. Having sniffed the dead man s lips I detected a slightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of exclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts. Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The forcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in Montpellier, will occur at once to any toxicologist.  And now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not been the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics, then, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me. I was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder had, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there all the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political one, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription was discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my opinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found, however, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to Cleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber s former career. He answered, you remember, in the negative.  I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer s height, and furnished me with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there were no signs of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderer s nose in his excitement. I could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom that any man, unless he is very fullblooded, breaks out in this way through emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddyfaced man. Events proved that I had judged correctly.  Having left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I telegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry to the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The answer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson Hope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that I held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to secure the murderer.  I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven the cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside the house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third person, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished to dog another through London, what better means could he adopt than to turn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible conclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the Metropolis.  If he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to be. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would be likely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time at least, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to suppose that he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore organized my Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically to every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted. How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of it, are still fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was an incident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in any case have been prevented. Through it, as you know, I came into possession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised. You see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break or flaw.   It is wonderful!  I cried.  Your merits should be publicly recognized. You should publish an account of the case. If you won t, I will for you.   You may do what you like, Doctor,  he answered.  See here!  he continued, handing a paper over to me,  look at this!  It was the _Echo_ for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed was devoted to the case in question.  The public,  it said,  have lost a sensational treat through the sudden death of the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr. Enoch Drebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The details of the case will probably be never known now, though we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part. It seems that both the victims belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and Hope, the deceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City. If the case has had no other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most striking manner the efficiency of our detective police force, and will serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at home, and not to carry them on to British soil. It is an open secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the wellknown Scotland Yard officials, Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson. The man was apprehended, it appears, in the rooms of a certain Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who has himself, as an amateur, shown some talent in the detective line, and who, with such instructors, may hope in time to attain to some degree of their skill. It is expected that a testimonial of some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of their services.   Didn t I tell you so when we started?  cried Sherlock Holmes with a laugh.  That s the result of all our Study in Scarlet to get them a testimonial!   Never mind,  I answered,  I have all the facts in my journal, and the public shall know them. In the meantime you must make yourself contented by the consciousness of success, like the Roman miser   Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo Ipse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca. '"

              "'CHAPTER I. MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES. In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy s country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new duties. The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a packhorse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines. Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship  Orontes,  and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it. I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as air or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile. On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at the Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at Barts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and we started off together in a hansom.  Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?  he asked in undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.  You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.  I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination.  Poor devil!  he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my misfortunes.  What are you up to now?   Looking for lodgings,  I answered.  Trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.   That s a strange thing,  remarked my companion  you are the second man today that has used that expression to me.   And who was the first?  I asked.  A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital. He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which were too much for his purse.   By Jove!  I cried,  if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner to being alone.  Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wineglass.  You don t know Sherlock Holmes yet,  he said  perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion.   Why, what is there against him?   Oh, I didn t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer in his ideas an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I know he is a decent fellow enough.   A medical student, I suppose?  said I.  No I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well up in anatomy, and he is a firstclass chemist but, as far as I know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of outofthe way knowledge which would astonish his professors.   Did you never ask him what he was going in for?  I asked.  No he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him.   I should like to meet him,  I said.  If I am to lodge with anyone, I should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How could I meet this friend of yours?   He is sure to be at the laboratory,  returned my companion.  He either avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to night. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.   Certainly,  I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other channels. As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellowlodger.  You mustn t blame me if you don t get on with him,  he said  I know nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me responsible.   If we don t get on it will be easy to part company,  I answered.  It seems to me, Stamford,  I added, looking hard at my companion,  that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow s temper so formidable, or what is it? Don t be mealymouthed about it.   It is not easy to express the inexpressible,  he answered with a laugh.  Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes it approaches to coldbloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge.   Very right too.   Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the subjects in the dissectingrooms with a stick, it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape.   Beating the subjects!   Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him at it with my own eyes.   And yet you say he is not a medical student?   No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are, and you must form your own impressions about him.  As he spoke, we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small sidedoor, which opened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me, and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and duncoloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory. This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles. Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, testtubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames. There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure.  I ve found it! I ve found it,  he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a testtube in his hand.  I have found a reagent which is precipitated by h moglobin, and by nothing else.  Had he discovered a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.  Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,  said Stamford, introducing us.  How are you?  he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for which I should hardly have given him credit.  You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive.   How on earth did you know that?  I asked in astonishment.  Never mind,  said he, chuckling to himself.  The question now is about h moglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?   It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,  I answered,  but practically   Why, man, it is the most practical medicolegal discovery for years. Don t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come over here now!  He seized me by the coatsleeve in his eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he had been working.  Let us have some fresh blood,  he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette.  Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.  As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar.  Ha! ha!  he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy.  What do you think of that?   It seems to be a very delicate test,  I remarked.  Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.   Indeed!  I murmured.  Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock Holmes  test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.  His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination.  You are to be congratulated,  I remarked, considerably surprised at his enthusiasm.  There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier, and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive.   You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,  said Stamford with a laugh.  You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the  Police News of the Past.   Very interesting reading it might be made, too,  remarked Sherlock Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger.  I have to be careful,  he continued, turning to me with a smile,  for I dabble with poisons a good deal.  He held out his hand as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong acids.  We came here on business,  said Stamford, sitting down on a high threelegged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his foot.  My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought that I had better bring you together.  Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me.  I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,  he said,  which would suit us down to the ground. You don t mind the smell of strong tobacco, I hope?   I always smoke  ship s  myself,  I answered.  That s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally do experiments. Would that annoy you?   By no means.   Let me see what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at times, and don t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I ll soon be right. What have you to confess now? It s just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together.  I laughed at this crossexamination.  I keep a bull pup,  I said,  and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices when I m well, but those are the principal ones at present.   Do you include violinplaying in your category of rows?  he asked, anxiously.  It depends on the player,  I answered.  A wellplayed violin is a treat for the gods a badlyplayed one   Oh, that s all right,  he cried, with a merry laugh.  I think we may consider the thing as settled that is, if the rooms are agreeable to you.   When shall we see them?   Call for me here at noon tomorrow, and we ll go together and settle everything,  he answered.  All right noon exactly,  said I, shaking his hand. We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards my hotel.  By the way,  I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford,  how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?  My companion smiled an enigmatical smile.  That s just his little peculiarity,  he said.  A good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out.   Oh! a mystery is it?  I cried, rubbing my hands.  This is very piquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together.  The proper study of mankind is man,  you know.   You must study him, then,  Stamford said, as he bade me goodbye.  You ll find him a knotty problem, though. I ll wager he learns more about you than you about him. Goodbye.   Goodbye,  I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably interested in my new acquaintance. CHAPTER II. THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION. We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They consisted of a couple of comfortable bedrooms and a single large airy sittingroom, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings. Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissectingrooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sittingroom, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion. As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded and his thin, hawklike nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments. The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how objectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my attention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these circumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it. He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question, confirmed Stamford s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance into the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view. Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason for doing so. His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.  You appear to be astonished,  he said, smiling at my expression of surprise.  Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.   To forget it!   You see,  he explained,  I consider that a man s brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brainattic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.   But the Solar System!  I protested.  What the deuce is it to me?  he interrupted impatiently  you say that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.  I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I pondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw my deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was exceptionally wellinformed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down. I could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It ran in this way  SHERLOCK HOLMES his limits. 1. Knowledge of Literature. Nil. 2. Philosophy. Nil. 3. Astronomy. Nil. 4. Politics. Feeble. 5. Botany. Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons generally. Knows nothing of practical gardening. 6. Geology. Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different soils from each other. After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers, and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he had received them. 7. Chemistry. Profound. 8. Anatomy. Accurate, but unsystematic. 9. Sensational Literature. Immense. He appears to know every detail of every horror perpetrated in the century. 10. Plays the violin well. 11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman. 12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law. When I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair.  If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all these accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,  I said to myself,  I may as well give up the attempt at once.  I see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These were very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments. That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn s Lieder, and other favourites. When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in his armchair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience. During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently, however, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most different classes of society. There was one little sallow ratfaced, darkeyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came three or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same afternoon brought a greyheaded, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely followed by a slipshod elderly woman. On another occasion an old whitehaired gentleman had an interview with my companion and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sittingroom, and I would retire to my bedroom. He always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience.  I have to use this room as a place of business,  he said,  and these people are my clients.  Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject of his own accord. It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it. Its somewhat ambitious title was  The Book of Life,  and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be farfetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man s inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer.  From a drop of water,  said the writer,  a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study nor, is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems. Let him, on meeting a fellowmortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to which he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look for. By a man s finger nails, by his coatsleeve, by his boot, by his trouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirt cuffs by each of these things a man s calling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.   What ineffable twaddle!  I cried, slapping the magazine down on the table,  I never read such rubbish in my life.   What is it?  asked Sherlock Holmes.  Why, this article,  I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat down to my breakfast.  I see that you have read it since you have marked it. I don t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. It is evidently the theory of some armchair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not practical. I should like to see him clapped down in a third class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his fellowtravellers. I would lay a thousand to one against him.   You would lose your money,  Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly.  As for the article I wrote it myself.   You!   Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The theories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so chimerical are really extremely practical so practical that I depend upon them for my bread and cheese.   And how?  I asked involuntarily.  Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the world. I m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is. Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger ends, it is odd if you can t unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade is a wellknown detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case, and that was what brought him here.   And these other people?   They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all people who are in trouble about something, and want a little enlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and then I pocket my fee.   But do you mean to say,  I said,  that without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they have seen every detail for themselves?   Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.   You were told, no doubt.   Nothing of the sort. I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan. From long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran,  Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.  The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.   It is simple enough as you explain it,  I said, smiling.  You remind me of Edgar Allen Poe s Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories.  Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe.  No doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,  he observed.  Now, in my opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking in on his friends  thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour s silence is really very showy and superficial. He had some analytical genius, no doubt but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.   Have you read Gaboriau s works?  I asked.  Does Lecoq come up to your idea of a detective?  Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically.  Lecoq was a miserable bungler,  he said, in an angry voice  he had only one thing to recommend him, and that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question was how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twentyfour hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a textbook for detectives to teach them what to avoid.  I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired treated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood looking out into the busy street.  This fellow may be very clever,  I said to myself,  but he is certainly very conceited.   There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,  he said, querulously.  What is the use of having brains in our profession. I know well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the result? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it.  I was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought it best to change the topic.  I wonder what that fellow is looking for?  I asked, pointing to a stalwart, plainlydressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had a large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a message.  You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,  said Sherlock Holmes.  Brag and bounce!  thought I to myself.  He knows that I cannot verify his guess.  The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were watching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across the roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps ascending the stair.  For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,  he said, stepping into the room and handing my friend the letter. Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little thought of this when he made that random shot.  May I ask, my lad,  I said, in the blandest voice,  what your trade may be?   Commissionaire, sir,  he said, gruffly.  Uniform away for repairs.   And you were?  I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my companion.  A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right, sir.  He clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was gone. CHAPTER III. THE LAURISTON GARDENS MYSTERY I confess that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companion s theories. My respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking suspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a prearranged episode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could have in taking me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him he had finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant, lacklustre expression which showed mental abstraction.  How in the world did you deduce that?  I asked.  Deduce what?  said he, petulantly.  Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.   I have no time for trifles,  he answered, brusquely then with a smile,  Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts but perhaps it is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that man was a sergeant of Marines?   No, indeed.   It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you were asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the street I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the fellow s hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage, however, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was a man with some amount of selfimportance and a certain air of command. You must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his cane. A steady, respectable, middleaged man, too, on the face of him all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.   Wonderful!  I ejaculated.  Commonplace,  said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that he was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration.  I said just now that there were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong look at this!  He threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought.  Why,  I cried, as I cast my eye over it,  this is terrible!   It does seem to be a little out of the common,  he remarked, calmly.  Would you mind reading it to me aloud?  This is the letter which I read to him   MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,   There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens, off the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in the morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that something was amiss. He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of  Enoch J. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.  There had been no robbery, nor is there any evidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of blood in the room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a loss as to how he came into the empty house indeed, the whole affair is a puzzler. If you can come round to the house any time before twelve, you will find me there. I have left everything _in statu quo_ until I hear from you. If you are unable to come I shall give you fuller details, and would esteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion. Yours faithfully,  TOBIAS GREGSON.   Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,  my friend remarked  he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and energetic, but conventional shockingly so. They have their knives into one another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional beauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put upon the scent.  I was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on.  Surely there is not a moment to be lost,  I cried,  shall I go and order you a cab?   I m not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy devil that ever stood in shoe leather that is, when the fit is on me, for I can be spry enough at times.   Why, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.   My dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel the whole matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will pocket all the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.   But he begs you to help him.   Yes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me but he would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person. However, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my own hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!  He hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that an energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.  Get your hat,  he said.  You wish me to come?   Yes, if you have nothing better to do.  A minute later we were both in a hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road. It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a duncoloured veil hung over the housetops, looking like the reflection of the mudcoloured streets beneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away about Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and an Amati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.  You don t seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,  I said at last, interrupting Holmes  musical disquisition.  No data yet,  he answered.  It is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.   You will have your data soon,  I remarked, pointing with my finger  this is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much mistaken.   So it is. Stop, driver, stop!  We were still a hundred yards or so from it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey upon foot. Number 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an illomened and minatory look. It was one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two being occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and there a  To Let  card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by a threefoot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within. I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be further from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the opposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny, he proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass which flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice he stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it. Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from me. At the door of the house we were met by a tall, whitefaced, flaxenhaired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and wrung my companion s hand with effusion.  It is indeed kind of you to come,  he said,  I have had everything left untouched.   Except that!  my friend answered, pointing at the pathway.  If a herd of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No doubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you permitted this.   I have had so much to do inside the house,  the detective said evasively.  My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him to look after this.  Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically.  With two such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be much for a third party to find out,  he said. Gregson rubbed his hands in a selfsatisfied way.  I think we have done all that can be done,  he answered  it s a queer case though, and I knew your taste for such things.   You did not come here in a cab?  asked Sherlock Holmes.  No, sir.   Nor Lestrade?   No, sir.   Then let us go and look at the room.  With which inconsequent remark he strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features expressed his astonishment. A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of these had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the diningroom, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires. It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was blotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath. Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment. All these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling. It was that of a man about fortythree or fortyfour years of age, middlesized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with lightcoloured trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and apelike appearance, which was increased by his writhing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London. Lestrade, lean and ferretlike as ever, was standing by the doorway, and greeted my companion and myself.  This case will make a stir, sir,  he remarked.  It beats anything I have seen, and I am no chicken.   There is no clue?  said Gregson.  None at all,  chimed in Lestrade. Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it intently.  You are sure that there is no wound?  he asked, pointing to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.  Positive!  cried both detectives.  Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual presumably the murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the year  34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?   No, sir.   Read it up you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It has all been done before.  As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same faraway expression which I have already remarked upon. So swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness with which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the dead man s lips, and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots.  He has not been moved at all?  he asked.  No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.   You can take him to the mortuary now,  he said.  There is nothing more to be learned.  Gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered the room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised him, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes.  There s been a woman here,  he cried.  It s a woman s weddingring.  He held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered round him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.  This complicates matters,  said Gregson.  Heaven knows, they were complicated enough before.   You re sure it doesn t simplify them?  observed Holmes.  There s nothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his pockets?   We have it all here,  said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs.  A gold watch, No. 97163, by Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring, with masonic device. Gold pin bulldog s head, with rubies as eyes. Russian leather cardcase, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland, corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse, but loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition of Boccaccio s _Decameron_, with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the flyleaf. Two letters one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph Stangerson.   At what address?   American Exchange, Strand to be left till called for. They are both from the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their boats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return to New York.   Have you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?   I did it at once, sir,  said Gregson.  I have had advertisements sent to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American Exchange, but he has not returned yet.   Have you sent to Cleveland?   We telegraphed this morning.   How did you word your inquiries?   We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad of any information which could help us.   You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to be crucial?   I asked about Stangerson.   Nothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears to hinge? Will you not telegraph again?   I have said all I have to say,  said Gregson, in an offended voice. Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make some remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we were holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene, rubbing his hands in a pompous and selfsatisfied manner.  Mr. Gregson,  he said,  I have just made a discovery of the highest importance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a careful examination of the walls.  The little man s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his colleague.  Come here,  he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate.  Now, stand there!  He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.  Look at that!  he said, triumphantly. I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a yellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was scrawled in bloodred letters a single word  RACHE.  What do you think of that?  cried the detective, with the air of a showman exhibiting his show.  This was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The murderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where it has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See that candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall.   And what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?  asked Gregson in a depreciatory voice.  Mean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name Rachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark my words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a woman named Rachel has something to do with it. It s all very well for you to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever, but the old hound is the best, when all is said and done.   I really beg your pardon!  said my companion, who had ruffled the little man s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter.  You certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out, and, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the other participant in last night s mystery. I have not had time to examine this room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.  As he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying glass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly about the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once lying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of encouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded of a pureblooded welltrained foxhound as it dashes backwards and forwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes across the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his researches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one place he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor, and packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his glass the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the most minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.  They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,  he remarked with a smile.  It s a very bad definition, but it does apply to detective work.  Gregson and Lestrade had watched the man uvres of their amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently failed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that Sherlock Holmes  smallest actions were all directed towards some definite and practical end.  What do you think of it, sir?  they both asked.  It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume to help you,  remarked my friend.  You are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere.  There was a world of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke.  If you will let me know how your investigations go,  he continued,  I shall be happy to give you any help I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who found the body. Can you give me his name and address?  Lestrade glanced at his notebook.  John Rance,  he said.  He is off duty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.  Holmes took a note of the address.  Come along, Doctor,  he said  we shall go and look him up. I ll tell you one thing which may help you in the case,  he continued, turning to the two detectives.  There has been murder done, and the murderer was a man. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had small feet for his height, wore coarse, squaretoed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a fourwheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and the fingernails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only a few indications, but they may assist you.  Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.  If this man was murdered, how was it done?  asked the former.  Poison,  said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off.  One other thing, Lestrade,  he added, turning round at the door  Rache,  is the German for  revenge  so don t lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.  With which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals openmouthed behind him. CHAPTER IV. WHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL. It was one o clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by Lestrade.  There is nothing like first hand evidence,  he remarked  as a matter of fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as well learn all that is to be learned.   You amaze me, Holmes,  said I.  Surely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.   There s no room for a mistake,  he answered.  The very first thing which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the morning I have Gregson s word for that it follows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two individuals to the house.   That seems simple enough,  said I  but how about the other man s height?   Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from the length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though there is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow s stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of checking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct leads him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing was just over six feet from the ground. It was child s play.   And his age?  I asked.  Well, if a man can stride four and ahalf feet without the smallest effort, he can t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across. Patentleather boots had gone round, and Squaretoes had hopped over. There is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I advocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?   The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,  I suggested.  The writing on the wall was done with a man s forefinger dipped in blood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man s nail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor. It was dark in colour and flakey such an ash as is only made by a Trichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes in fact, I have written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar or of tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type.   And the florid face?  I asked.  Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was right. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.  I passed my hand over my brow.  My head is in a whirl,  I remarked  the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these two men if there were two men into an empty house? What has become of the cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take poison? Where did the blood come from? What was the object of the murderer, since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman s ring there? Above all, why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconciling all these facts.  My companion smiled approvingly.  You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,  he said.  There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up my mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade s discovery it was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German. The A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel. I m not going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick, and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.   I shall never do that,  I answered  you have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.  My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way in which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty.  I ll tell you one other thing,  he said.  Patentleathers and Squaretoes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as possible arminarm, in all probability. When they got inside they walked up and down the room or rather, Patentleathers stood still while Squaretoes walked up and down. I could read all that in the dust and I could read that as he walked he grew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of his strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no doubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I ve told you all I know myself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good working basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want to go to Halle s concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.  This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary byways. In the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand.  That s Audley Court in there,  he said, pointing to a narrow slit in the line of deadcoloured brick.  You ll find me here when you come back.  Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was engraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming. He appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in his slumbers.  I made my report at the office,  he said. Holmes took a halfsovereign from his pocket and played with it pensively.  We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips,  he said.  I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,  the constable answered with his eyes upon the little golden disk.  Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.  Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though determined not to omit anything in his narrative.  I ll tell it ye from the beginning,  he said.  My time is from ten at night to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the  White Hart  but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o clock it began to rain, and I met Harry Murcher him who has the Holland Grove beat and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street atalkin . Presently maybe about two or a little after I thought I would take a look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was precious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down, though a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin  down, thinkin  between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same house. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty on account of him that owns them who won t have the drains seen to, though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o  typhoid fever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the window, and I suspected as something was wrong. When I got to the door   You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,  my companion interrupted.  What did you do that for?  Rance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the utmost amazement upon his features.  Why, that s true, sir,  he said  though how you come to know it, Heaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still and so lonesome, that I thought I d be none the worse for some one with me. I ain t afeared of anything on this side o  the grave but I thought that maybe it was him that died o  the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o  turn, and I walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher s lantern, but there wasn t no sign of him nor of anyone else.   There was no one in the street?   Not a livin  soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself together and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside, so I went into the room where the light was aburnin . There was a candle flickerin  on the mantelpiece a red wax one and by its light I saw   Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times, and you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried the kitchen door, and then  John Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in his eyes.  Where was you hid to see all that?  he cried.  It seems to me that you knows a deal more than you should.  Holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable.  Don t get arresting me for the murder,  he said.  I am one of the hounds and not the wolf Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for that. Go on, though. What did you do next?  Rance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified expression.  I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That brought Murcher and two more to the spot.   Was the street empty then?   Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.   What do you mean?  The constable s features broadened into a grin.  I ve seen many a drunk chap in my time,  he said,  but never anyone so cryin  drunk as that cove. He was at the gate when I came out, aleanin  up agin the railings, and asingin  at the pitch o  his lungs about Columbine s Newfangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn t stand, far less help.   What sort of a man was he?  asked Sherlock Holmes. John Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression.  He was an uncommon drunk sort o  man,  he said.  He d ha  found hisself in the station if we hadn t been so took up.   His face his dress didn t you notice them?  Holmes broke in impatiently.  I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up me and Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower part muffled round   That will do,  cried Holmes.  What became of him?   We d enough to do without lookin  after him,  the policeman said, in an aggrieved voice.  I ll wager he found his way home all right.   How was he dressed?   A brown overcoat.   Had he a whip in his hand?   A whip no.   He must have left it behind,  muttered my companion.  You didn t happen to see or hear a cab after that?   No.   There s a halfsovereign for you,  my companion said, standing up and taking his hat.  I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the force. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. You might have gained your sergeant s stripes last night. The man whom you held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and whom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it now I tell you that it is so. Come along, Doctor.  We started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous, but obviously uncomfortable.  The blundering fool,  Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our lodgings.  Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good luck, and not taking advantage of it.   I am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of this man tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. But why should he come back to the house after leaving it? That is not the way of criminals.   The ring, man, the ring that was what he came back for. If we have no other way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. I shall have him, Doctor I ll lay you two to one that I have him. I must thank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you, and so have missed the finest study I ever came across a study in scarlet, eh? Why shouldn t we use a little art jargon. There s the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it. And now for lunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack and her bowing are splendid. What s that little thing of Chopin s she plays so magnificently Tralalaliraliralay.  Leaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a lark while I meditated upon the manysidedness of the human mind. CHAPTER V. OUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR. Our morning s exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was tired out in the afternoon. After Holmes  departure for the concert, I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours  sleep. It was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted baboonlike countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that I found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its owner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most malignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the depravity of the victim was no condonement in the eyes of the law. The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion s hypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he had sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something which had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what had caused the man s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of strangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist. As long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would be no easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet selfconfident manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained all the facts, though what it was I could not for an instant conjecture. He was very late in returning so late, that I knew that the concert could not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table before he appeared.  It was magnificent,  he said, as he took his seat.  Do you remember what Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood.   That s rather a broad idea,  I remarked.  One s ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature,  he answered.  What s the matter? You re not looking quite yourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.   To tell the truth, it has,  I said.  I ought to be more casehardened after my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at Maiwand without losing my nerve.   I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you seen the evening paper?   No.   It gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the fact that when the man was raised up, a woman s wedding ring fell upon the floor. It is just as well it does not.   Why?   Look at this advertisement,  he answered.  I had one sent to every paper this morning immediately after the affair.  He threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated. It was the first announcement in the  Found  column.  In Brixton Road, this morning,  it ran,  a plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway between the  White Hart  Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson, 221B, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening.   Excuse my using your name,  he said.  If I used my own some of these dunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.   That is all right,  I answered.  But supposing anyone applies, I have no ring.   Oh yes, you have,  said he, handing me one.  This will do very well. It is almost a facsimile.   And who do you expect will answer this advertisement.   Why, the man in the brown coat our florid friend with the square toes. If he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.   Would he not consider it as too dangerous?   Not at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason to believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose the ring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebber s body, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the house he discovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police already in possession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning. He had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put yourself in that man s place. On thinking the matter over, it must have occurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving the house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly look out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found. His eye, of course, would light upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why should he fear a trap? There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder. He would come. He will come. You shall see him within an hour?   And then?  I asked.  Oh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?   I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.   You had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man, and though I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for anything.  I went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with the pistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.  The plot thickens,  he said, as I entered  I have just had an answer to my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.   And that is?  I asked eagerly.  My fiddle would be the better for new strings,  he remarked.  Put your pistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an ordinary way. Leave the rest to me. Don t frighten him by looking at him too hard.   It is eight o clock now,  I said, glancing at my watch.  Yes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door slightly. That will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you! This is a queer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday De Jure inter Gentes published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642. Charles  head was still firm on his shoulders when this little brownbacked volume was struck off.   Who is the printer?   Philippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the flyleaf, in very faded ink, is written  Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.  I wonder who William Whyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His writing has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think.  As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the servant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she opened it.  Does Dr. Watson live here?  asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We could not hear the servant s reply, but the door closed, and some one began to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling one. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he listened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a feeble tap at the door.  Come in,  I cried. At my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be dazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket with nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do to keep my countenance. The old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our advertisement.  It s this as has brought me, good gentlemen,  she said, dropping another curtsey  a gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road. It belongs to my girl Sally, as was married only this time twelvemonth, which her husband is steward aboard a Union boat, and what he d say if he come  ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think, he being short enough at the best o  times, but more especially when he has the drink. If it please you, she went to the circus last night along with   Is that her ring?  I asked.  The Lord be thanked!  cried the old woman  Sally will be a glad woman this night. That s the ring.   And what may your address be?  I inquired, taking up a pencil.  13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here.   The Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,  said Sherlock Holmes sharply. The old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little redrimmed eyes.  The gentleman asked me for _my_ address,  she said.  Sally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.   And your name is ?   My name is Sawyer her s is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her and a smart, clean lad, too, as long as he s at sea, and no steward in the company more thought of but when on shore, what with the women and what with liquor shops   Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,  I interrupted, in obedience to a sign from my companion  it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner.  With many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone packed it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs. Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into his room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and a cravat.  I ll follow her,  he said, hurriedly  she must be an accomplice, and will lead me to him. Wait up for me.  The hall door had hardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended the stair. Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly along the other side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind.  Either his whole theory is incorrect,  I thought to myself,  or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery.  There was no need for him to ask me to wait up for him, for I felt that sleep was impossible until I heard the result of his adventure. It was close upon nine when he set out. I had no idea how long he might be, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of Henri Murger s  Vie de Boh me.  Ten o clock passed, and I heard the footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven, and the more stately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same destination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of his latchkey. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not been successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the mastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a hearty laugh.  I wouldn t have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,  he cried, dropping into his chair  I have chaffed them so much that they would never have let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh, because I know that I will be even with them in the long run.   What is it then?  I asked.  Oh, I don t mind telling a story against myself. That creature had gone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being footsore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a fourwheeler which was passing. I managed to be close to her so as to hear the address, but I need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud enough to be heard at the other side of the street,  Drive to 13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch,  she cried. This begins to look genuine, I thought, and having seen her safely inside, I perched myself behind. That s an art which every detective should be an expert at. Well, away we rattled, and never drew rein until we reached the street in question. I hopped off before we came to the door, and strolled down the street in an easy, lounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver jumped down, and I saw him open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing came out though. When I reached him he was groping about frantically in the empty cab, and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever I listened to. There was no sign or trace of his passenger, and I fear it will be some time before he gets his fare. On inquiring at Number 13 we found that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger, named Keswick, and that no one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there.   You don t mean to say,  I cried, in amazement,  that that tottering, feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion, without either you or the driver seeing her?   Old woman be damned!  said Sherlock Holmes, sharply.  We were the old women to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an active one, too, besides being an incomparable actor. The getup was inimitable. He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this means of giving me the slip. It shows that the man we are after is not as lonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who are ready to risk something for him. Now, Doctor, you are looking doneup. Take my advice and turn in.  I was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. I left Holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the watches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his violin, and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he had set himself to unravel. CHAPTER VI. TOBIAS GREGSON SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO. The papers next day were full of the  Brixton Mystery,  as they termed it. Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it in addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I still retain in my scrapbook numerous clippings and extracts bearing upon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them  The _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German name of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister inscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political refugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in America, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten laws, and been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff Highway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England. The _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from the unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening of all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had been residing for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the boardinghouse of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell. He was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th inst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of catching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together upon the platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber s body was, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road, many miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are questions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the whereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and Mr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it is confidently anticipated that these wellknown officers will speedily throw light upon the matter. The _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being a political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated the Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores a number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not soured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these men there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was punished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary, Stangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the deceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address of the house at which he had boarded a result which was entirely due to the acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard. Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and they appeared to afford him considerable amusement.  I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure to score.   That depends on how it turns out.   Oh, bless you, it doesn t matter in the least. If the man is caught, it will be _on account_ of their exertions if he escapes, it will be _in spite_ of their exertions. It s heads I win and tails you lose. Whatever they do, they will have followers.  Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l admire.   What on earth is this?  I cried, for at this moment there came the pattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by audible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.  It s the Baker Street division of the detective police force,  said my companion, gravely and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a dozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped eyes on.  Tention!  cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little scoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes.  In future you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you must wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?   No, sir, we hain t,  said one of the youths.  I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are your wages.  He handed each of them a shilling.  Now, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.  He waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats, and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.  There s more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than out of a dozen of the force,  Holmes remarked.  The mere sight of an officiallooking person seals men s lips. These youngsters, however, go everywhere and hear everything. They are as sharp as needles, too all they want is organisation.   Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?  I asked.  Yes there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matter of time. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance! Here is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every feature of his face. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There he is!  There was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the fairhaired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and burst into our sittingroom.  My dear fellow,  he cried, wringing Holmes  unresponsive hand,  congratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day.  A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion s expressive face.  Do you mean that you are on the right track?  he asked.  The right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.   And his name is?   Arthur Charpentier, sublieutenant in Her Majesty s navy,  cried Gregson, pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest. Sherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile.  Take a seat, and try one of these cigars,  he said.  We are anxious to know how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?   I don t mind if I do,  the detective answered.  The tremendous exertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain upon the mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both brainworkers.   You do me too much honour,  said Holmes, gravely.  Let us hear how you arrived at this most gratifying result.  The detective seated himself in the armchair, and puffed complacently at his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of amusement.  The fun of it is,  he cried,  that that fool Lestrade, who thinks himself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is after the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this time.  The idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.  And how did you get your clue?   Ah, I ll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is strictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to contend with was the finding of this American s antecedents. Some people would have waited until their advertisements were answered, or until parties came forward and volunteered information. That is not Tobias Gregson s way of going to work. You remember the hat beside the dead man?   Yes,  said Holmes  by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.  Gregson looked quite crestfallen.  I had no idea that you noticed that,  he said.  Have you been there?   No.   Ha!  cried Gregson, in a relieved voice  you should never neglect a chance, however small it may seem.   To a great mind, nothing is little,  remarked Holmes, sententiously.  Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that size and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once. He had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier s Boarding Establishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address.   Smart very smart!  murmured Sherlock Holmes.  I next called upon Madame Charpentier,  continued the detective.  I found her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room, too an uncommonly fine girl she is, too she was looking red about the eyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. That didn t escape my notice. I began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, when you come upon the right scent a kind of thrill in your nerves.  Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder Mr. Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?  I asked.  The mother nodded. She didn t seem able to get out a word. The daughter burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter.  At what o clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?  I asked.  At eight o clock,  she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her agitation.  His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two trains one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first.   And was that the last which you saw of him?   A terrible change came over the woman s face as I asked the question. Her features turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she could get out the single word  Yes and when it did come it was in a husky unnatural tone.  There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm clear voice.  No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,  she said.  Let us be frank with this gentleman. We _did_ see Mr. Drebber again.   God forgive you!  cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and sinking back in her chair.  You have murdered your brother.   Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,  the girl answered firmly.  You had best tell me all about it now,  I said.  Halfconfidences are worse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.   On your head be it, Alice!  cried her mother and then, turning to me,  I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be compromised. That however is surely impossible. His high character, his profession, his antecedents would all forbid it.   Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,  I answered.  Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.   Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,  she said, and her daughter withdrew.  Now, sir,  she continued,  I had no intention of telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all without omitting any particular.   It is your wisest course,  said I.  Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his secretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I noticed a  Copenhagen  label upon each of their trunks, showing that that had been their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet reserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise. He was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. The very night of his arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after twelve o clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober. His manners towards the maidservants were disgustingly free and familiar. Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way which, fortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one occasion he actually seized her in his arms and embraced her an outrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct.   But why did you stand all this,  I asked.  I suppose that you can get rid of your boarders when you wish.   Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question.  Would to God that I had given him notice on the very day that he came,  she said.  But it was a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each fourteen pounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy in the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for the best. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to leave on account of it. That was the reason of his going.   Well?   My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave just now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper is violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed the door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in less than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr. Drebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the worse for drink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to her that she should fly with him.  You are of age,  he said,  and there is no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the old girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live like a princess.  Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head. When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with a stick in his hand.  I don t think that fine fellow will trouble us again,  he said.  I will just go after him and see what he does with himself.  With those words he took his hat and started off down the street. The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber s mysterious death.   This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier s lips with many gasps and pauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words. I made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there should be no possibility of a mistake.   It s quite exciting,  said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn.  What happened next?   When Mrs. Charpentier paused,  the detective continued,  I saw that the whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way which I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her son returned.  I do not know,  she answered.  Not know?   No he has a latchkey, and he let himself in.   After you went to bed?   Yes.   When did you go to bed?   About eleven.   So your son was gone at least two hours?   Yes.   Possibly four or five?   Yes.   What was he doing during that time?   I do not know,  she answered, turning white to her very lips.  Of course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found out where Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and arrested him. When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass,  I suppose you are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel Drebber,  he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that his alluding to it had a most suspicious aspect.   Very,  said Holmes.  He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as having with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.   What is your theory, then?   Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road. When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course of which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach, perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night was so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and the writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent.   Well done!  said Holmes in an encouraging voice.  Really, Gregson, you are getting along. We shall make something of you yet.   I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,  the detective answered proudly.  The young man volunteered a statement, in which he said that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him, and took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an old shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this old shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. I think the whole case fits together uncommonly well. What amuses me is to think of Lestrade, who had started off upon the wrong scent. I am afraid he won t make much of it. Why, by Jove, here s the very man himself!  It was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were talking, and who now entered the room. The assurance and jauntiness which generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however, wanting. His face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged and untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of consulting with Sherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be embarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the room, fumbling nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do.  This is a most extraordinary case,  he said at last a most incomprehensible affair.   Ah, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade!  cried Gregson, triumphantly.  I thought you would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find the Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson?   The Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson,  said Lestrade gravely,  was murdered at Halliday s Private Hotel about six o clock this morning.  CHAPTER VII. LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS. The intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so unexpected, that we were all three fairly dumfoundered. Gregson sprang out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. I stared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes.  Stangerson too!  he muttered.  The plot thickens.   It was quite thick enough before,  grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair.  I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.   Are you are you sure of this piece of intelligence?  stammered Gregson.  I have just come from his room,  said Lestrade.  I was the first to discover what had occurred.   We have been hearing Gregson s view of the matter,  Holmes observed.  Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?   I have no objection,  Lestrade answered, seating himself.  I freely confess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the death of Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was completely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out what had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston Station about halfpast eight on the evening of the third. At two in the morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodginghouses in the vicinity of Euston. You see, I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated, the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the station again next morning.   They would be likely to agree on some meetingplace beforehand,  remarked Holmes.  So it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making enquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and at eight o clock I reached Halliday s Private Hotel, in Little George Street. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there, they at once answered me in the affirmative.  No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,  they said.  He has been waiting for a gentleman for two days.   Where is he now?  I asked.  He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.   I will go up and see him at once,  I said.  It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me the room it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor leading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about to go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish, in spite of my twenty years  experience. From under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side. I gave a cry, which brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he saw it. The door was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked it in. The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was quite dead, and had been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold. When we turned him over, the Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated the heart. And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man?  I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror, even before Sherlock Holmes answered.  The word RACHE, written in letters of blood,  he said.  That was it,  said Lestrade, in an awestruck voice and we were all silent for a while. There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle tingled as I thought of it.  The man was seen,  continued Lestrade.  A milk boy, passing on his way to the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay there, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which was wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular notice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a reddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder, for we found bloodstained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.  I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which tallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his face.  Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer?  he asked.  Nothing. Stangerson had Drebber s purse in his pocket, but it seems that this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd pounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. There were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man s pocket, except a single telegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the words,  J. H. is in Europe.  There was no name appended to this message.   And there was nothing else?  Holmes asked.  Nothing of any importance. The man s novel, with which he had read himself to sleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair beside him. There was a glass of water on the table, and on the windowsill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.  Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.  The last link,  he cried, exultantly.  My case is complete.  The two detectives stared at him in amazement.  I have now in my hands,  my companion said, confidently,  all the threads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, details to be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the time that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to the discovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own eyes. I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand upon those pills?   I have them,  said Lestrade, producing a small white box  I took them and the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place of safety at the Police Station. It was the merest chance my taking these pills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance to them.   Give them here,  said Holmes.  Now, Doctor,  turning to me,  are those ordinary pills?  They certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small, round, and almost transparent against the light.  From their lightness and transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,  I remarked.  Precisely so,  answered Holmes.  Now would you mind going down and fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long, and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday.  I went downstairs and carried the dog upstairs in my arms. Its laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end. Indeed, its snowwhite muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the rug.  I will now cut one of these pills in two,  said Holmes, and drawing his penknife he suited the action to the word.  One half we return into the box for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine glass, in which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our friend, the Doctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.   This may be very interesting,  said Lestrade, in the injured tone of one who suspects that he is being laughed at,  I cannot see, however, what it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.   Patience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has everything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps it up readily enough.  As he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock Holmes  earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling effect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretched upon the cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught. Holmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without result, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the table, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great was his emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two detectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check which he had met.  It can t be a coincidence,  he cried, at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room  it is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the case of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson. And yet they are inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible! And yet this wretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it! I have it!  With a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, cut the other pill in two, dissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the terrier. The unfortunate creature s tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning. Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his forehead.  I should have more faith,  he said  I ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation. Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that before ever I saw the box at all.  This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog, however, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began to have a dim, vague perception of the truth.  All this seems strange to you,  continued Holmes,  because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence of it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions. It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those _outr _ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more difficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.  Mr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable impatience, could contain himself no longer.  Look here, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,  he said,  we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart man, and that you have your own methods of working. We want something more than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a case of taking the man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. Young Charpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. Lestrade went after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too. You have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more than we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business. Can you name the man who did it?   I cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,  remarked Lestrade.  We have both tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked more than once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require. Surely you will not withhold it any longer.   Any delay in arresting the assassin,  I observed,  might give him time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity.  Thus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought.  There will be no more murders,  he said at last, stopping abruptly and facing us.  You can put that consideration out of the question. You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere knowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the power of laying our hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do. I have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements but it is a thing which needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by another who is as clever as himself. As long as this man has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him but if he had the slightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city. Without meaning to hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that I consider these men to be more than a match for the official force, and that is why I have not asked your assistance. If I fail I shall, of course, incur all the blame due to this omission but that I am prepared for. At present I am ready to promise that the instant that I can communicate with you without endangering my own combinations, I shall do so.  Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance, or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police. The former had flushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the other s beady eyes glistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither of them had time to speak, however, before there was a tap at the door, and the spokesman of the street Arabs, young Wiggins, introduced his insignificant and unsavoury person.  Please, sir,  he said, touching his forelock,  I have the cab downstairs.   Good boy,  said Holmes, blandly.  Why don t you introduce this pattern at Scotland Yard?  he continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs from a drawer.  See how beautifully the spring works. They fasten in an instant.   The old pattern is good enough,  remarked Lestrade,  if we can only find the man to put them on.   Very good, very good,  said Holmes, smiling.  The cabman may as well help me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.  I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about to set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it. There was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out and began to strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the room.  Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,  he said, kneeling over his task, and never turning his head. The fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put down his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click, the jangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.  Gentlemen,  he cried, with flashing eyes,  let me introduce you to Mr. Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson.  The whole thing occurred in a moment so quickly that I had no time to realize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes  triumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman s dazed, savage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a second or two we might have been a group of statues. Then, with an inarticulate roar of fury, the prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes s grasp, and hurled himself through the window. Woodwork and glass gave way before him but before he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds. He was dragged back into the room, and then commenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he, that the four of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. His face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass, but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. It was not until Lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and halfstrangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless and panting.  We have his cab,  said Sherlock Holmes.  It will serve to take him to Scotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,  he continued, with a pleasant smile,  we have reached the end of our little mystery. You are very welcome to put any questions that you like to me now, and there is no danger that I will refuse to answer them.  PART II. _The Country of the Saints._ CHAPTER I. ON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN. In the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a barrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises snowcapped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are swiftflowing rivers which dash through jagged ca ons and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the common characteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery. There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees or of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other huntinggrounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight of those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their prairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily through the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness. In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plainland, all dusted over with patches of alkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks, with their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch of country there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life. There is no bird in the steelblue heaven, no movement upon the dull, grey earth above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness nothing but silence complete and heartsubduing silence. It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones some large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside. Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May, eighteen hundred and fortyseven, a solitary traveller. His appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region. An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the brown parchmentlike skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones his long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white his eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his clothes, which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man was dying dying from hunger and from thirst. He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little elevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the great salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might indicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there was no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild questioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die.  Why not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,  he muttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder. Before sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle, and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had carried slung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground with some little violence. Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face, with very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists.  You ve hurt me!  said a childish voice reproachfully.  Have I though,  the man answered penitently,  I didn t go for to do it.  As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty little girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart pink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother s care. The child was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered less than her companion.  How is it now?  he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the towsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.  Kiss it and make it well,  she said, with perfect gravity, showing the injured part up to him.  That s what mother used to do. Where s mother?   Mother s gone. I guess you ll see her before long.   Gone, eh!  said the little girl.  Funny, she didn t say goodbye she  most always did if she was just goin  over to Auntie s for tea, and now she s been away three days. Say, it s awful dry, ain t it? Ain t there no water, nor nothing to eat?   No, there ain t nothing, dearie. You ll just need to be patient awhile, and then you ll be all right. Put your head up agin me like that, and then you ll feel bullier. It ain t easy to talk when your lips is like leather, but I guess I d best let you know how the cards lie. What s that you ve got?   Pretty things! fine things!  cried the little girl enthusiastically, holding up two glittering fragments of mica.  When we goes back to home I ll give them to brother Bob.   You ll see prettier things than them soon,  said the man confidently.  You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you though you remember when we left the river?   Oh, yes.   Well, we reckoned we d strike another river soon, d ye see. But there was somethin  wrong compasses, or map, or somethin , and it didn t turn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of you and and   And you couldn t wash yourself,  interrupted his companion gravely, staring up at his grimy visage.  No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian Pete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie, your mother.   Then mother s a deader too,  cried the little girl dropping her face in her pinafore and sobbing bitterly.  Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some chance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it together. It don t seem as though we ve improved matters. There s an almighty small chance for us now!   Do you mean that we are going to die too?  asked the child, checking her sobs, and raising her tearstained face.  I guess that s about the size of it.   Why didn t you say so before?  she said, laughing gleefully.  You gave me such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we ll be with mother again.   Yes, you will, dearie.   And you too. I ll tell her how awful good you ve been. I ll bet she meets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot of buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was fond of. How long will it be first?   I don t know not very long.  The man s eyes were fixed upon the northern horizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly did they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards, the vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death.  Cocks and hens,  cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their illomened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise.  Say, did God make this country?   In course He did,  said her companion, rather startled by this unexpected question.  He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,  the little girl continued.  I guess somebody else made the country in these parts. It s not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the trees.   What would ye think of offering up prayer?  the man asked diffidently.  It ain t night yet,  she answered.  It don t matter. It ain t quite regular, but He won t mind that, you bet. You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the waggon when we was on the Plains.   Why don t you say some yourself?  the child asked, with wondering eyes.  I disremember them,  he answered.  I hain t said none since I was half the height o  that gun. I guess it s never too late. You say them out, and I ll stand by and come in on the choruses.   Then you ll need to kneel down, and me too,  she said, laying the shawl out for that purpose.  You ve got to put your hands up like this. It makes you feel kind o  good.  It was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see it. Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the little prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her chubby face, and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom they were face to face, while the two voices the one thin and clear, the other deep and harsh united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness. The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad breast of her protector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids drooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the man s grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion, and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber. Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight would have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid, welldefined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds. As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvascovered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze, and the apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West. But what a caravan! When the head of it had reached the base of the mountains, the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Right across the enormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggons and carts, men on horseback, and men on foot. Innumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings. This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new country. There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above them. At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced men, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On reaching the base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council among themselves.  The wells are to the right, my brothers,  said one, a hardlipped, cleanshaven man with grizzly hair.  To the right of the Sierra Blanco so we shall reach the Rio Grande,  said another.  Fear not for water,  cried a third.  He who could draw it from the rocks will not now abandon His own chosen people.   Amen! Amen!  responded the whole party. They were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and keenesteyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag above them. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink, showing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight there was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while fresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word  Redskins  was on every lip.  There can t be any number of Injuns here,  said the elderly man who appeared to be in command.  We have passed the Pawnees, and there are no other tribes until we cross the great mountains.   Shall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,  asked one of the band.  And I,   and I,  cried a dozen voices.  Leave your horses below and we will await you here,  the Elder answered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their horses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object which had excited their curiosity. They advanced rapidly and noiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts. The watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the skyline. The young man who had first given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his followers saw him throw up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and on joining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met their eyes. On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man, longbearded and hardfeatured, but of an excessive thinness. His placid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep. Beside him lay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his brown sinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast of his velveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular line of snowwhite teeth within, and a playful smile played over her infantile features. Her plump little white legs terminating in white socks and neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast to the long shrivelled members of her companion. On the ledge of rock above this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight of the new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away. The cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about them in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down upon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him, and which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts. His face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he passed his boney hand over his eyes.  This is what they call delirium, I guess,  he muttered. The child stood beside him, holding on to the skirt of his coat, and said nothing but looked all round her with the wondering questioning gaze of childhood. The rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that their appearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little girl, and hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her gaunt companion, and assisted him towards the waggons.  My name is John Ferrier,  the wanderer explained  me and that little un are all that s left o  twentyone people. The rest is all dead o  thirst and hunger away down in the south.   Is she your child?  asked someone.  I guess she is now,  the other cried, defiantly  she s mine  cause I saved her. No man will take her from me. She s Lucy Ferrier from this day on. Who are you, though?  he continued, glancing with curiosity at his stalwart, sunburned rescuers  there seems to be a powerful lot of ye.   Nigh upon ten thousand,  said one of the young men  we are the persecuted children of God the chosen of the Angel Merona.   I never heard tell on him,  said the wanderer.  He appears to have chosen a fair crowd of ye.   Do not jest at that which is sacred,  said the other sternly.  We are of those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian letters on plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy Joseph Smith at Palmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of Illinois, where we had founded our temple. We have come to seek a refuge from the violent man and from the godless, even though it be the heart of the desert.  The name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier.  I see,  he said,  you are the Mormons.   We are the Mormons,  answered his companions with one voice.  And where are you going?   We do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of our Prophet. You must come before him. He shall say what is to be done with you.  They had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surrounded by crowds of the pilgrims palefaced meeklooking women, strong laughing children, and anxious earnesteyed men. Many were the cries of astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they perceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the other. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by a great crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was conspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of its appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were furnished with two, or, at most, four apiece. Beside the driver there sat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but whose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader. He was reading a brownbacked volume, but as the crowd approached he laid it aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode. Then he turned to the two castaways.  If we take you with us,  he said, in solemn words,  it can only be as believers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the whole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms?   Guess I ll come with you on any terms,  said Ferrier, with such emphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader alone retained his stern, impressive expression.  Take him, Brother Stangerson,  he said,  give him food and drink, and the child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!   On, on to Zion!  cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled down the long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a dull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a creaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon the whole caravan was winding along once more. The Elder to whose care the two waifs had been committed, led them to his waggon, where a meal was already awaiting them.  You shall remain here,  he said.  In a few days you will have recovered from your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and for ever you are of our religion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has spoken with the voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God.  CHAPTER II. THE FLOWER OF UTAH. This is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured by the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From the shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history. The savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and disease every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had all been overcome with AngloSaxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and the accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them. There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the promised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for evermore. Young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a resolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the future city was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and allotted in proportion to the standing of each individual. The tradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the town streets and squares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country there was draining and hedging, planting and clearing, until the next summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop. Everything prospered in the strange settlement. Above all, the great temple which they had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger. From the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight, the clatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the immigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers. The two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson s waggon, a retreat which she shared with the Mormon s three wives and with his son, a headstrong forward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of childhood, from the shock caused by her mother s death, she soon became a pet with the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvascovered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal Elders. On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial loghouse, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen in his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution enabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his lands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his neighbours, in six he was welltodo, in nine he was rich, and in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who could compare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch Mountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier. There was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities of his coreligionists. No argument or persuasion could ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions. He never gave reasons for this persistent refusal, but contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination. There were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion, and others who put it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense. Others, again, spoke of some early love affair, and of a fairhaired girl who had pined away on the shores of the Atlantic. Whatever the reason, Ferrier remained strictly celibate. In every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being an orthodox and straightwalking man. Lucy Ferrier grew up within the loghouse, and assisted her adopted father in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the balsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to the young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger, her cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by Ferrier s farm felt longforgotten thoughts revive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father s mustang, and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West. So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her father the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope. It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had developed into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious change is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns, with a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has awoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and remember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life. In the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself, apart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides. It was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavilyladen mules, all heading to the west, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the Overland Route lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands, and trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy Ferrier, her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her. She had a commission from her father in the City, and was dashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed. The travelstained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and even the unemotional Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the palefaced maiden. She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a halfdozen wildlooking herdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap. Scarcely had she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed in behind her, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of fierceeyed, longhorned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to deal with cattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took advantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way through the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider. The situation was full of peril. Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns again, and goaded it to fresh madness. It was all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals. Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her head began to swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax. Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she might have abandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance. At the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts.  You re not hurt, I hope, miss,  said her preserver, respectfully. She looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily.  I m awful frightened,  she said, naively  whoever would have thought that Poncho would have been so scared by a lot of cows?   Thank God you kept your seat,  the other said earnestly. He was a tall, savagelooking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse, and clad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over his shoulders.  I guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,  he remarked,  I saw you ride down from his house. When you see him, ask him if he remembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis. If he s the same Ferrier, my father and he were pretty thick.   Hadn t you better come and ask yourself?  she asked, demurely. The young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure.  I ll do so,  he said,  we ve been in the mountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting condition. He must take us as he finds us.   He has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,  she answered,  he s awful fond of me. If those cows had jumped on me he d have never got over it.   Neither would I,  said her companion.  You! Well, I don t see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow. You ain t even a friend of ours.  The young hunter s dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy Ferrier laughed aloud.  There, I didn t mean that,  she said  of course, you are a friend now. You must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won t trust me with his business any more. Goodbye!   Goodbye,  he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over her little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her ridingwhip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of dust. Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn. He and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver, and were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital enough to work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as keen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn his thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young girl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his volcanic, untamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished from his sight, he realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that neither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to him as this new and allabsorbing one. The love which had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather the wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper. He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook. He swore in his heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human perseverance could render him successful. He called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until his face was a familiar one at the farmhouse. John, cooped up in the valley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning the news of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this Jefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested Lucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in those wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a silver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to be had, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became a favourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. On such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright, happy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer her own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms, but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her affections. It was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled up at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He threw the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.  I am off, Lucy,  he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing tenderly down into her face  I won t ask you to come with me now, but will you be ready to come when I am here again?   And when will that be?  she asked, blushing and laughing.  A couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then, my darling. There s no one who can stand between us.   And how about father?  she asked.  He has given his consent, provided we get these mines working all right. I have no fear on that head.   Oh, well of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there s no more to be said,  she whispered, with her cheek against his broad breast.  Thank God!  he said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her.  It is settled, then. The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They are waiting for me at the ca on. Goodbye, my own darling goodbye. In two months you shall see me.  He tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his horse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though afraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what he was leaving. She stood at the gate, gazing after him until he vanished from her sight. Then she walked back into the house, the happiest girl in all Utah. CHAPTER III. JOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET. Three weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had departed from Salt Lake City. John Ferrier s heart was sore within him when he thought of the young man s return, and of the impending loss of his adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always determined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he regarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever he might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was inflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in the Land of the Saints. Yes, a dangerous matter so dangerous that even the most saintly dared only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something which fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a swift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turned persecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most terrible description. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German Vehmgericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over the State of Utah. Its invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this organization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out against the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or what had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home, but no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands of his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed by annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this terrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men went about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them. At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the recalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards to pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The supply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female population on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange rumours began to be bandied about rumours of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women appeared in the harems of the Elders women who pined and wept, and bore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated wanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked, stealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. These tales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and recorroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name. To this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite Band, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an illomened one. Fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible results served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it inspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless society. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret. The very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the Prophet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence every man feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were nearest his heart. One fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields, when he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window, saw a stout, sandyhaired, middleaged man coming up the pathway. His heart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great Brigham Young himself. Full of trepidation for he knew that such a visit boded him little good Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief. The latter, however, received his salutations coldly, and followed him with a stern face into the sittingroom.  Brother Ferrier,  he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly from under his lightcoloured eyelashes,  the true believers have been good friends to you. We picked you up when you were starving in the desert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley, gave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our protection. Is not this so?   It is so,  answered John Ferrier.  In return for all this we asked but one condition that was, that you should embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages. This you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you have neglected.   And how have I neglected it?  asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in expostulation.  Have I not given to the common fund? Have I not attended at the Temple? Have I not ?   Where are your wives?  asked Young, looking round him.  Call them in, that I may greet them.   It is true that I have not married,  Ferrier answered.  But women were few, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a lonely man I had my daughter to attend to my wants.   It is of that daughter that I would speak to you,  said the leader of the Mormons.  She has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land.  John Ferrier groaned internally.  There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve stories that she is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues. What is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith?  Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect for if she wed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.  This being so, it is impossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your daughter to violate it.  John Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his ridingwhip.  Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested so it has been decided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would not have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all choice. We Elders have many heifers,1 but our children must also be provided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choose between them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say you to that?  1 Heber C. Kemball, in one of his sermons, alludes to his hundred wives under this endearing epithet. Ferrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.  You will give us time,  he said at last.  My daughter is very young she is scarce of an age to marry.   She shall have a month to choose,  said Young, rising from his seat.  At the end of that time she shall give her answer.  He was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face and flashing eyes.  It were better for you, John Ferrier,  he thundered,  that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra Blanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of the Holy Four!  With a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and Ferrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path. He was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he should broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon his, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her pale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed.  I could not help it,  she said, in answer to his look.  His voice rang through the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?   Don t you scare yourself,  he answered, drawing her to him, and passing his broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair.  We ll fix it up somehow or another. You don t find your fancy kind o  lessening for this chap, do you?  A sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer.  No of course not. I shouldn t care to hear you say you did. He s a likely lad, and he s a Christian, which is more than these folk here, in spite o  all their praying and preaching. There s a party starting for Nevada tomorrow, and I ll manage to send him a message letting him know the hole we are in. If I know anything o  that young man, he ll be back here with a speed that would whip electrotelegraphs.  Lucy laughed through her tears at her father s description.  When he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you that I am frightened, dear. One hears one hears such dreadful stories about those who oppose the Prophet something terrible always happens to them.   But we haven t opposed him yet,  her father answered.  It will be time to look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us at the end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.   Leave Utah!   That s about the size of it.   But the farm?   We will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell the truth, Lucy, it isn t the first time I have thought of doing it. I don t care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their darned prophet. I m a freeborn American, and it s all new to me. Guess I m too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this farm, he might chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite direction.   But they won t let us leave,  his daughter objected.  Wait till Jefferson comes, and we ll soon manage that. In the meantime, don t you fret yourself, my dearie, and don t get your eyes swelled up, else he ll be walking into me when he sees you. There s nothing to be afeared about, and there s no danger at all.  John Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone, but she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the fastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom. CHAPTER IV. A FLIGHT FOR LIFE. On the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet, John Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his acquaintance, who was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted him with his message to Jefferson Hope. In it he told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he should return. Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and returned home with a lighter heart. As he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to each of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on entering to find two young men in possession of his sittingroom. One, with a long pale face, was leaning back in the rockingchair, with his feet cocked up upon the stove. The other, a bullnecked youth with coarse bloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands in his pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both of them nodded to Ferrier as he entered, and the one in the rockingchair commenced the conversation.  Maybe you don t know us,  he said.  This here is the son of Elder Drebber, and I m Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true fold.   As He will all the nations in His own good time,  said the other in a nasal voice  He grindeth slowly but exceeding small.  John Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.  We have come,  continued Stangerson,  at the advice of our fathers to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has seven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.   Nay, nay, Brother Stangerson,  cried the other  the question is not how many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now given over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.   But my prospects are better,  said the other, warmly.  When the Lord removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.   It will be for the maiden to decide,  rejoined young Drebber, smirking at his own reflection in the glass.  We will leave it all to her decision.  During this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway, hardly able to keep his ridingwhip from the backs of his two visitors.  Look here,  he said at last, striding up to them,  when my daughter summons you, you can come, but until then I don t want to see your faces again.  The two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this competition between them for the maiden s hand was the highest of honours both to her and her father.  There are two ways out of the room,  cried Ferrier  there is the door, and there is the window. Which do you care to use?  His brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening, that his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. The old farmer followed them to the door.  Let me know when you have settled which it is to be,  he said, sardonically.  You shall smart for this!  Stangerson cried, white with rage.  You have defied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to the end of your days.   The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,  cried young Drebber  He will arise and smite you!   Then I ll start the smiting,  exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would have rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and restrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses  hoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.  The young canting rascals!  he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from his forehead  I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the wife of either of them.   And so should I, father,  she answered, with spirit  but Jefferson will soon be here.   Yes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for we do not know what their next move may be.  It was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted daughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been such a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If minor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this arch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no avail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been spirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He was a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which hung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but this suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease. He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from Young as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an unlookedfor manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his surprise, a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters   Twentynine days are given you for amendment, and then  The dash was more fearinspiring than any threat could have been. How this warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his servants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been secured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but the incident struck a chill into his heart. The twentynine days were evidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. What strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such mysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck him to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him. Still more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their breakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the centre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the number 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not enlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27 had been painted upon the outside of his door. Thus day followed day and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls, sometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John Ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada. Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news of the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there came no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a driver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking that help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to four and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of escape. Singlehanded, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The morefrequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could pass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he would, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him. Yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter s dishonour. He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, and searching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown the figure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the last of the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague and terrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter what was to become of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the invisible network which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon the table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence. What was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound low, but very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of the house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was repeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open. Outside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were twinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the farmer s eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on the road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier looked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at his own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face upon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl. So unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying man, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within the house the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson Hope.  Good God!  gasped John Ferrier.  How you scared me! Whatever made you come in like that.   Give me food,  the other said, hoarsely.  I have had no time for bite or sup for eightandforty hours.  He flung himself upon the cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host s supper, and devoured it voraciously.  Does Lucy bear up well?  he asked, when he had satisfied his hunger.  Yes. She does not know the danger,  her father answered.  That is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I crawled my way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they re not quite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter.  John Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a devoted ally. He seized the young man s leathery hand and wrung it cordially.  You re a man to be proud of,  he said.  There are not many who would come to share our danger and our troubles.   You ve hit it there, pard,  the young hunter answered.  I have a respect for you, but if you were alone in this business I d think twice before I put my head into such a hornet s nest. It s Lucy that brings me here, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o  the Hope family in Utah.   What are we to do?   Tomorrow is your last day, and unless you act tonight you are lost. I have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much money have you?   Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.   That will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for Carson City through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as well that the servants do not sleep in the house.  While Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching journey, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into a small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by experience that the mountain wells were few and far between. He had hardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his daughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between the lovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was much to be done.  We must make our start at once,  said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a low but resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the peril, but has steeled his heart to meet it.  The front and back entrances are watched, but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the fields. Once on the road we are only two miles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we should be halfway through the mountains.   What if we are stopped,  asked Ferrier. Hope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his tunic.  If they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them with us,  he said with a sinister smile. The lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the darkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own, and which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved himself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes. All looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grainland, that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head. Ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scanty provisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and carefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. With bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained the shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow, where they lay silent and trembling. It was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the ears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the melancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of them, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small distance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal cry again, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity.  Tomorrow at midnight,  said the first who appeared to be in authority.  When the WhippoorWill calls three times.   It is well,  returned the other.  Shall I tell Brother Drebber?   Pass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven!   Seven to five!  repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away in different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some form of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died away in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping his companions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the top of his speed, supporting and halfcarrying the girl when her strength appeared to fail her.  Hurry on! hurry on!  he gasped from time to time.  We are through the line of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!  Once on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they meet anyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid recognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged peaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led between them was the Eagle Ca on in which the horses were awaiting them. With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great boulders and along the bed of a driedup watercourse, until he came to the retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful animals had been picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old Ferrier upon one of the horses, with his moneybag, while Jefferson Hope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path. It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face Nature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a thousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic columns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster. On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance impossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow in places that they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that only practised riders could have traversed it at all. Yet in spite of all dangers and difficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light within them, for every step increased the distance between them and the terrible despotism from which they were flying. They soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the jurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most desolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and pointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark and plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them as soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of  Who goes there?  rang through the silent ravine.  Travellers for Nevada,  said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the rifle which hung by his saddle. They could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down at them as if dissatisfied at their reply.  By whose permission?  he asked.  The Holy Four,  answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught him that that was the highest authority to which he could refer.  Nine from seven,  cried the sentinel.  Seven from five,  returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the countersign which he had heard in the garden.  Pass, and the Lord go with you,  said the voice from above. Beyond his post the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a trot. Looking back, they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon his gun, and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen people, and that freedom lay before them. CHAPTER V. THE AVENGING ANGELS. All night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular and rockstrewn paths. More than once they lost their way, but Hope s intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them. In every direction the great snowcapped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each other s shoulders to the far horizon. So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear entirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they passed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a gallop. As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great mountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until they were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her father would fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable.  They will be upon our track by this time,  he said.  Everything depends upon our speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for the remainder of our lives.  During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their enemies. At nighttime they chose the base of a beetling crag, where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there huddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours  sleep. Before daybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had seen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could reach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them. About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness, however, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had frequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life. Choosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air was bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animals stood motionless in the background. Then the intervening rocks hid them from his view. He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity. At last, after two or three hours  fruitless search, he was thinking of turning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic horns. The bighorn for so it is called was acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The animal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath. The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy over his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening was already drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he realized the difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had wandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in which he found himself divided and subdivided into many gorges, which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other. He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey. He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously, for he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen reecho to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an answer. None came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary silent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation. When he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead silence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to convictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the remains of the fire animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no traces behind it. Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He was essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence. Seizing a halfconsumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help to examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet of horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of his companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side of the camp was a lowlying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly not been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything but a newlydug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point JOHN FERRIER, FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY, Died August 4th, 1860. The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone, then, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round to see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder s son. As the young fellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to prevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in his last silent restingplace. Again, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs from despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least devote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance, Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived. As he stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution, brought by his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring energy should, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim, white face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a few days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the avenging angels. For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down among the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep but before daybreak he was always well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle Ca on, from which they had commenced their illfated flight. Thence he could look down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of festivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse s hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding towards him. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named Cowper, to whom he had rendered services at different times. He therefore accosted him when he got up to him, with the object of finding out what Lucy Ferrier s fate had been.  I am Jefferson Hope,  he said.  You remember me.  The Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment indeed, it was difficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly white face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former days. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity, the man s surprise changed to consternation.  You are mad to come here,  he cried.  It is as much as my own life is worth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from the Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.   I don t fear them, or their warrant,  Hope said, earnestly.  You must know something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you hold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For God s sake, don t refuse to answer me.   What is it?  the Mormon asked uneasily.  Be quick. The very rocks have ears and the trees eyes.   What has become of Lucy Ferrier?   She was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you have no life left in you.   Don t mind me,  said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning.  Married, you say?   Married yesterday that s what those flags are for on the Endowment House. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson as to which was to have her. They d both been in the party that followed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the best claim but when they argued it out in council, Drebber s party was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one won t have her very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday. She is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then?   Yes, I am off,  said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. His face might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its expression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.  Where are you going?   Never mind,  he answered and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder, strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself. The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her head again, but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish husband, who had married her principally for the sake of John Ferrier s property, did not affect any great grief at his bereavement but his other wives mourned over her, and sat up with her the night before the burial, as is the Mormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and astonishment, the door was flung open, and a savagelooking, weatherbeaten man in tattered garments strode into the room. Without a glance or a word to the cowering women, he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching up her hand, he took the weddingring from her finger.  She shall not be buried in that,  he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. So strange and so brief was the episode, that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared. For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson s window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having their houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness. Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter s mind was of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any other emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soon realized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome food were wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains, what was to become of his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play his enemy s game, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there to recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation. His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that memorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier s grave. Disguised, and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to be justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger members of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the Elders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the malcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson and no one knew whither they had gone. Rumour reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his property into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. There was no clue at all, however, as to their whereabouts. Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of revenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never faltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked out by such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town through the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he had devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window, had recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in his eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by Stangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into custody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some weeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that Drebber s house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had departed for Europe. Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred urged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and for some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his approaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in him, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to city, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the fugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris and when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off for Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for they had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running them to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than quote the old hunter s own account, as duly recorded in Dr. Watson s Journal, to which we are already under such obligations. CHAPTER VI. A CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON, M.D. Our prisoner s furious resistance did not apparently indicate any ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself powerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes that he had not hurt any of us in the scuffle.  I guess you re going to take me to the policestation,  he remarked to Sherlock Holmes.  My cab s at the door. If you ll loose my legs I ll walk down to it. I m not so light to lift as I used to be.  Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this proposition rather a bold one but Holmes at once took the prisoner at his word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ankles. He rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself that they were free once more. I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed him, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was as formidable as his personal strength.  If there s a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you are the man for it,  he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my fellowlodger.  The way you kept on my trail was a caution.   You had better come with me,  said Holmes to the two detectives.  I can drive you,  said Lestrade.  Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us.  I assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made no attempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his, and we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse, and brought us in a very short time to our destination. We were ushered into a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner s name and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged. The official was a whitefaced unemotional man, who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way.  The prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week,  he said  in the mean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn you that your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.   I ve got a good deal to say,  our prisoner said slowly.  I want to tell you gentlemen all about it.   Hadn t you better reserve that for your trial?  asked the Inspector.  I may never be tried,  he answered.  You needn t look startled. It isn t suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?  He turned his fierce dark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.  Yes I am,  I answered.  Then put your hand here,  he said, with a smile, motioning with his manacled wrists towards his chest. I did so and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful engine was at work. In the silence of the room I could hear a dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source.  Why,  I cried,  you have an aortic aneurism!   That s what they call it,  he said, placidly.  I went to a Doctor last week about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before many days passed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from overexposure and underfeeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I ve done my work now, and I don t care how soon I go, but I should like to leave some account of the business behind me. I don t want to be remembered as a common cutthroat.  The Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the advisability of allowing him to tell his story.  Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?  the former asked.  Most certainly there is,  I answered.  In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to take his statement,  said the Inspector.  You are at liberty, sir, to give your account, which I again warn you will be taken down.   I ll sit down, with your leave,  the prisoner said, suiting the action to the word.  This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I m on the brink of the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I say is the absolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to me.  With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began the following remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical manner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough. I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had access to Lestrade s notebook, in which the prisoner s words were taken down exactly as they were uttered.  It don t much matter to you why I hated these men,  he said  it s enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings a father and a daughter and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own lives. After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. I knew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one. You d have done the same, if you have any manhood in you, if you had been in my place.  That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. She was forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart over it. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished. I have carried it about with me, and have followed him and his accomplice over two continents until I caught them. They thought to tire me out, but they could not do it. If I die tomorrow, as is likely enough, I die knowing that my work in this world is done, and well done. They have perished, and by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire.  They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I found that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner s office, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to the owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the mazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had a map beside me though, and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and stations, I got on pretty well.  It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them. They were at a boardinghouse at Camberwell, over on the other side of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at my mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their recognizing me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my opportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again.  They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about London, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they could not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or late at night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand with my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted.  They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone, and never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every day, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them late and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance but I was not discouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work undone.  At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the street was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to their door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time Drebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my horse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I feared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on to the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them. Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the matter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch what Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that he must not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday s Private Hotel to which Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven, and made his way out of the station.  The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my enemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue precipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and returned but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed. By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from interruption. How to get Drebber to that house was the difficult problem which I had now to solve.  He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying for nearly halfanhour in the last of them. When he came out he staggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a hansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets, until, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in which he had boarded. I could not imagine what his intention was in returning there but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from the house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away. Give me a glass of water, if you please. My mouth gets dry with the talking.  I handed him the glass, and he drank it down.  That s better,  he said.  Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or more, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen before. This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half across the road.  You hound,  he cried, shaking his stick at him  I ll teach you to insult an honest girl!  He was so hot that I think he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He ran as far as the corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and jumped in.  Drive me to Halliday s Private Hotel,  said he.  When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that I feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove along slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I might take him right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane have my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this, when he solved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again, and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leaving word that I should wait for him. There he remained until closing time, and when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my own hands.  Don t imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only have been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself to do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for his life if he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets which I have filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day the professor was lecturing on poisons, and he showed his students some alkaloid, as he called it, which he had extracted from some South American arrow poison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant death. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and when they were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a fairly good dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison. I determined at the time that when I had my chance, my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I ate the pill that remained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief. From that day I had always my pill boxes about with me, and the time had now come when I was to use them.  It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard and raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within so glad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty long years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would understand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my nerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with excitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I see you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on each side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road.  There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the dripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber all huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm,  It s time to get out,  I said.  All right, cabby,  said he.  I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned, for he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden. I had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little topheavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the front room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the daughter were walking in front of us.  It s infernally dark,  said he, stamping about.  We ll soon have a light,  I said, striking a match and putting it to a wax candle which I had brought with me.  Now, Enoch Drebber,  I continued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face,  who am I?   He gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which showed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I saw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered in his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and laughed loud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be sweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me.  You dog!  I said  I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St. Petersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your wanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see tomorrow s sun rise.  He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I could see on his face that he thought I was mad. So I was for the time. The pulses in my temples beat like sledgehammers, and I believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me.  What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?  I cried, locking the door, and shaking the key in his face.  Punishment has been slow in coming, but it has overtaken you at last.  I saw his coward lips tremble as I spoke. He would have begged for his life, but he knew well that it was useless.  Would you murder me?  he stammered.  There is no murder,  I answered.  Who talks of murdering a mad dog? What mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her slaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless harem.   It was not I who killed her father,  he cried.  But it was you who broke her innocent heart,  I shrieked, thrusting the box before him.  Let the high God judge between us. Choose and eat. There is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you leave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are ruled by chance.   He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I swallowed the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die. Shall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as I saw it, and held Lucy s marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was but for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm of pain contorted his features he threw his hands out in front of him, staggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I turned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There was no movement. He was dead!  The blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice of it. I don t know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police upon a wrong track, for I felt lighthearted and cheerful. I remembered a German being found in New York with RACHE written up above him, and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must have done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall. Then I walked down to my cab and found that there was nobody about, and that the night was still very wild. I had driven some distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which I usually kept Lucy s ring, and found that it was not there. I was thunderstruck at this, for it was the only memento that I had of her. Thinking that I might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber s body, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldly up to the house for I was ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into the arms of a policeofficer who was coming out, and only managed to disarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk.  That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was to do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier s debt. I knew that he was staying at Halliday s Private Hotel, and I hung about all day, but he never came out. I fancy that he suspected something when Drebber failed to put in an appearance. He was cunning, was Stangerson, and always on his guard. If he thought he could keep me off by staying indoors he was very much mistaken. I soon found out which was the window of his bedroom, and early next morning I took advantage of some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so made my way into his room in the grey of the dawn. I woke him up and told him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so long before. I described Drebber s death to him, and I gave him the same choice of the poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at the chance of safety which that offered him, he sprang from his bed and flew at my throat. In selfdefence I stabbed him to the heart. It would have been the same in any case, for Providence would never have allowed his guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison.  I have little more to say, and it s as well, for I am about done up. I went on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I could save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next thing I knew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and as neatly shackled as ever I saw in my life. That s the whole of my story, gentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer but I hold that I am just as much an officer of justice as you are.  So thrilling had the man s narrative been, and his manner was so impressive that we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professional detectives, _blas _ as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to be keenly interested in the man s story. When he finished we sat for some minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of Lestrade s pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand account.  There is only one point on which I should like a little more information,  Sherlock Holmes said at last.  Who was your accomplice who came for the ring which I advertised?  The prisoner winked at my friend jocosely.  I can tell my own secrets,  he said,  but I don t get other people into trouble. I saw your advertisement, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might be the ring which I wanted. My friend volunteered to go and see. I think you ll own he did it smartly.   Not a doubt of that,  said Holmes heartily.  Now, gentlemen,  the Inspector remarked gravely,  the forms of the law must be complied with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before the magistrates, and your attendance will be required. Until then I will be responsible for him.  He rang the bell as he spoke, and Jefferson Hope was led off by a couple of warders, while my friend and I made our way out of the Station and took a cab back to Baker Street. CHAPTER VII. THE CONCLUSION. We had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the Thursday but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our testimony. A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson Hope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would be meted out to him. On the very night after his capture the aneurism burst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the cell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been able in his dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work well done.  Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,  Holmes remarked, as we chatted it over next evening.  Where will their grand advertisement be now?   I don t see that they had very much to do with his capture,  I answered.  What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,  returned my companion, bitterly.  The question is, what can you make people believe that you have done. Never mind,  he continued, more brightly, after a pause.  I would not have missed the investigation for anything. There has been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there were several most instructive points about it.   Simple!  I ejaculated.  Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,  said Sherlock Holmes, smiling at my surprise.  The proof of its intrinsic simplicity is, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days.   That is true,  said I.  I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very useful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise it much. In the everyday affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.   I confess,  said I,  that I do not quite follow you.   I hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer. Most people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you what the result would be. They can put those events together in their minds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are few people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning backwards, or analytically.   I understand,  said I.  Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you the different steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I approached the house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely free from all impressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway, and there, as I have already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which, I ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during the night. I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman s brougham.  This was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden path, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable for taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps. Happily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice has made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the constables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been before the others, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them. In this way my second link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number, one remarkable for his height as I calculated from the length of his stride, and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots.  On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My wellbooted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder there was. There was no wound upon the dead man s person, but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or any sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their features. Having sniffed the dead man s lips I detected a slightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of exclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts. Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The forcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in Montpellier, will occur at once to any toxicologist.  And now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not been the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics, then, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me. I was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder had, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there all the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political one, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription was discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my opinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found, however, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to Cleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber s former career. He answered, you remember, in the negative.  I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer s height, and furnished me with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there were no signs of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderer s nose in his excitement. I could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom that any man, unless he is very fullblooded, breaks out in this way through emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddyfaced man. Events proved that I had judged correctly.  Having left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I telegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry to the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The answer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson Hope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that I held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to secure the murderer.  I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven the cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside the house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third person, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished to dog another through London, what better means could he adopt than to turn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible conclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the Metropolis.  If he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to be. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would be likely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time at least, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to suppose that he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore organized my Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically to every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted. How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of it, are still fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was an incident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in any case have been prevented. Through it, as you know, I came into possession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised. You see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break or flaw.   It is wonderful!  I cried.  Your merits should be publicly recognized. You should publish an account of the case. If you won t, I will for you.   You may do what you like, Doctor,  he answered.  See here!  he continued, handing a paper over to me,  look at this!  It was the _Echo_ for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed was devoted to the case in question.  The public,  it said,  have lost a sensational treat through the sudden death of the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr. Enoch Drebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The details of the case will probably be never known now, though we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part. It seems that both the victims belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and Hope, the deceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City. If the case has had no other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most striking manner the efficiency of our detective police force, and will serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at home, and not to carry them on to British soil. It is an open secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the wellknown Scotland Yard officials, Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson. The man was apprehended, it appears, in the rooms of a certain Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who has himself, as an amateur, shown some talent in the detective line, and who, with such instructors, may hope in time to attain to some degree of their skill. It is expected that a testimonial of some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of their services.   Didn t I tell you so when we started?  cried Sherlock Holmes with a laugh.  That s the result of all our Study in Scarlet to get them a testimonial!   Never mind,  I answered,  I have all the facts in my journal, and the public shall know them. In the meantime you must make yourself contented by the consciousness of success, like the Roman miser   Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo Ipse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca. '"

surgeons in the army having completed my studies there i was duly attached to the fifth northumberland fusiliers as assistant surgeon the regiment was stationed in india at the time and before i could join it the second afghan war had broken out on landing at bombay i learned that my corps had advanced through the passes and was already deep in the enemy s country i followed however with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself and succeeded in reaching candahar in safety where i found my regiment and at once entered upon my new duties the campaign brought honours and promotion to many but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster i was removed from my brigade and attached to the berkshires with whom i served at the fatal battle of maiwand there i was struck on the shoulder by a jezail bullet which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery i should have fallen into the hands of the murderous ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by murray my orderly who threw me across a packhorse and succeeded in bringing me safely to the british lines worn with pain and weak from the prolonged hardships which i had undergone i was removed with a great train of wounded sufferers to the base hospital at peshawar here i rallied and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards and even to bask a little upon the verandah when i was struck down by enteric fever that curse of our indian possessions for months my life was despaired of and when at last i came to myself and became convalescent i was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to england i was dispatched accordingly in the troopship  orontes  and landed a month later on portsmouth jetty with my health irretrievably ruined but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it i had neither kith nor kin in england and was therefore as free as air or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be under such circumstances i naturally gravitated to london that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the empire are irresistibly drained there i stayed for some time at a private hotel in the strand leading a comfortless meaningless existence and spending such money as i had considerably more freely than i ought so alarming did the state of my finances become that i soon realized that i must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country or that i must make a complete alteration in my style of living choosing the latter alternative i began by making up my mind to leave the hotel and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile on the very day that i had come to this conclusion i was standing at the criterion bar when some one tapped me on the shoulder and turning round i recognized young stamford who had been a dresser under me at barts the sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of london is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man in old days stamford had never been a particular crony of mine but now i hailed him with enthusiasm and he in his turn appeared to be delighted to see me in the exuberance of my joy i asked him to lunch with me at the holborn and we started off together in a hansom  whatever have you been doing with yourself watson?  he asked in undisguised wonder as we rattled through the crowded london streets  you are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut  i gave him a short sketch of my adventures and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination  poor devil!  he said commiseratingly after he had listened to my misfortunes  what are you up to now?   looking for lodgings  i answered  trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price   that s a strange thing  remarked my companion  you are the second man today that has used that expression to me   and who was the first?  i asked  a fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital he was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found and which were too much for his purse   by jove!  i cried  if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense i am the very man for him i should prefer having a partner to being alone  young stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wineglass  you don t know sherlock holmes yet  he said  perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion   why what is there against him?   oh i didn t say there was anything against him he is a little queer in his ideas an enthusiast in some branches of science as far as i know he is a decent fellow enough   a medical student i suppose?  said i  no i have no idea what he intends to go in for i believe he is well up in anatomy and he is a firstclass chemist but as far as i know he has never taken out any systematic medical classes his studies are very desultory and eccentric but he has amassed a lot of outofthe way knowledge which would astonish his professors   did you never ask him what he was going in for?  i asked  no he is not a man that it is easy to draw out though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him   i should like to meet him  i said  if i am to lodge with anyone i should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits i am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement i had enough of both in afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence how could i meet this friend of yours?   he is sure to be at the laboratory  returned my companion  he either avoids the place for weeks or else he works there from morning to night if you like we shall drive round together after luncheon   certainly  i answered and the conversation drifted away into other channels as we made our way to the hospital after leaving the holborn stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom i proposed to take as a fellowlodger  you mustn t blame me if you don t get on with him  he said  i know nothing more of him than i have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory you proposed this arrangement so you must not hold me responsible   if we don t get on it will be easy to part company  i answered  it seems to me stamford  i added looking hard at my companion  that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter is this fellow s temper so formidable or what is it? don t be mealymouthed about it   it is not easy to express the inexpressible  he answered with a laugh  holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes it approaches to coldbloodedness i could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid not out of malevolence you understand but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects to do him justice i think that he would take it himself with the same readiness he appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge   very right too   yes but it may be pushed to excess when it comes to beating the subjects in the dissectingrooms with a stick it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape   beating the subjects!   yes to verify how far bruises may be produced after death i saw him at it with my own eyes   and yet you say he is not a medical student?   no heaven knows what the objects of his studies are but here we are and you must form your own impressions about him  as he spoke we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small sidedoor which opened into a wing of the great hospital it was familiar ground to me and i needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and duncoloured doors near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory this was a lofty chamber lined and littered with countless bottles broad low tables were scattered about which bristled with retorts testtubes and little bunsen lamps with their blue flickering flames there was only one student in the room who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work at the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure  i ve found it! i ve found it  he shouted to my companion running towards us with a testtube in his hand  i have found a reagent which is precipitated by h moglobin and by nothing else  had he discovered a gold mine greater delight could not have shone upon his features  dr watson mr sherlock holmes  said stamford introducing us  how are you?  he said cordially gripping my hand with a strength for which i should hardly have given him credit  you have been in afghanistan i perceive   how on earth did you know that?  i asked in astonishment  never mind  said he chuckling to himself  the question now is about h moglobin no doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?   it is interesting chemically no doubt  i answered  but practically   why man it is the most practical medicolegal discovery for years don t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains come over here now!  he seized me by the coatsleeve in his eagerness and drew me over to the table at which he had been working  let us have some fresh blood  he said digging a long bodkin into his finger and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette  now i add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water you perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water the proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million i have no doubt however that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction  as he spoke he threw into the vessel a few white crystals and then added some drops of a transparent fluid in an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar  ha! ha!  he cried clapping his hands and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy  what do you think of that?   it seems to be a very delicate test  i remarked  beautiful! beautiful! the old guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain so is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles the latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old now this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new had this test been invented there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes   indeed!  i murmured  criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point a man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed his linen or clothes are examined and brownish stains discovered upon them are they blood stains or mud stains or rust stains or fruit stains or what are they? that is a question which has puzzled many an expert and why? because there was no reliable test now we have the sherlock holmes  test and there will no longer be any difficulty  his eyes fairly glittered as he spoke and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination  you are to be congratulated  i remarked considerably surprised at his enthusiasm  there was the case of von bischoff at frankfort last year he would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence then there was mason of bradford and the notorious muller and lefevre of montpellier and samson of new orleans i could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive   you seem to be a walking calendar of crime  said stamford with a laugh  you might start a paper on those lines call it the  police news of the past   very interesting reading it might be made too  remarked sherlock holmes sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger  i have to be careful  he continued turning to me with a smile  for i dabble with poisons a good deal  he held out his hand as he spoke and i noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster and discoloured with strong acids  we came here on business  said stamford sitting down on a high threelegged stool and pushing another one in my direction with his foot  my friend here wants to take diggings and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you i thought that i had better bring you together  sherlock holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me  i have my eye on a suite in baker street  he said  which would suit us down to the ground you don t mind the smell of strong tobacco i hope?   i always smoke  ship s  myself  i answered  that s good enough i generally have chemicals about and occasionally do experiments would that annoy you?   by no means   let me see what are my other shortcomings i get in the dumps at times and don t open my mouth for days on end you must not think i am sulky when i do that just let me alone and i ll soon be right what have you to confess now? it s just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together  i laughed at this crossexamination  i keep a bull pup  i said  and i object to rows because my nerves are shaken and i get up at all sorts of ungodly hours and i am extremely lazy i have another set of vices when i m well but those are the principal ones at present   do you include violinplaying in your category of rows?  he asked anxiously  it depends on the player  i answered  a wellplayed violin is a treat for the gods a badlyplayed one   oh that s all right  he cried with a merry laugh  i think we may consider the thing as settled that is if the rooms are agreeable to you   when shall we see them?   call for me here at noon tomorrow and we ll go together and settle everything  he answered  all right noon exactly  said i shaking his hand we left him working among his chemicals and we walked together towards my hotel  by the way  i asked suddenly stopping and turning upon stamford  how the deuce did he know that i had come from afghanistan?  my companion smiled an enigmatical smile  that s just his little peculiarity  he said  a good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out   oh! a mystery is it?  i cried rubbing my hands  this is very piquant i am much obliged to you for bringing us together  the proper study of mankind is man  you know   you must study him then  stamford said as he bade me goodbye  you ll find him a knotty problem though i ll wager he learns more about you than you about him goodbye   goodbye  i answered and strolled on to my hotel considerably interested in my new acquaintance chapter ii the science of deduction we met next day as he had arranged and inspected the rooms at no 221b baker street of which he had spoken at our meeting they consisted of a couple of comfortable bedrooms and a single large airy sittingroom cheerfully furnished and illuminated by two broad windows so desirable in every way were the apartments and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us that the bargain was concluded upon the spot and we at once entered into possession that very evening i moved my things round from the hotel and on the following morning sherlock holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus for a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage that done we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with he was quiet in his ways and his habits were regular it was rare for him to be up after ten at night and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before i rose in the morning sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory sometimes in the dissectingrooms and occasionally in long walks which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the city nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him but now and again a reaction would seize him and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sittingroom hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night on these occasions i have noticed such a dreamy vacant expression in his eyes that i might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion as the weeks went by my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life gradually deepened and increased his very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer in height he was rather over six feet and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller his eyes were sharp and piercing save during those intervals of torpor to which i have alluded and his thin hawklike nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision his chin too had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination his hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch as i frequently had occasion to observe when i watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments the reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody when i confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity and how often i endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself before pronouncing judgment however be it remembered how objectless was my life and how little there was to engage my attention my health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial and i had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence under these circumstances i eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it he was not studying medicine he had himself in reply to a question confirmed stamford s opinion upon that point neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance into the learned world yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning no man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason for doing so his ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge of contemporary literature philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing upon my quoting thomas carlyle he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had done my surprise reached a climax however when i found incidentally that he was ignorant of the copernican theory and of the composition of the solar system that any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that i could hardly realize it  you appear to be astonished  he said smiling at my expression of surprise  now that i do know it i shall do my best to forget it   to forget it!   you see  he explained  i consider that a man s brain originally is like a little empty attic and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose a fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brainattic he will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work but of these he has a large assortment and all in the most perfect order it is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before it is of the highest importance therefore not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones   but the solar system!  i protested  what the deuce is it to me?  he interrupted impatiently  you say that we go round the sun if we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work  i was on the point of asking him what that work might be but something in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one i pondered over our short conversation however and endeavoured to draw my deductions from it he said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object therefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to him i enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was exceptionally wellinformed i even took a pencil and jotted them down i could not help smiling at the document when i had completed it it ran in this way  sherlock holmes his limits 1 knowledge of literature nil 2 philosophy nil 3 astronomy nil 4 politics feeble 5 botany variable well up in belladonna opium and poisons generally knows nothing of practical gardening 6 geology practical but limited tells at a glance different soils from each other after walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of london he had received them 7 chemistry profound 8 anatomy accurate but unsystematic 9 sensational literature immense he appears to know every detail of every horror perpetrated in the century 10 plays the violin well 11 is an expert singlestick player boxer and swordsman 12 has a good practical knowledge of british law when i had got so far in my list i threw it into the fire in despair  if i can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all these accomplishments and discovering a calling which needs them all  i said to myself  i may as well give up the attempt at once  i see that i have alluded above to his powers upon the violin these were very remarkable but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments that he could play pieces and difficult pieces i knew well because at my request he has played me some of mendelssohn s lieder and other favourites when left to himself however he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air leaning back in his armchair of an evening he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him but whether the music aided those thoughts or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than i could determine i might have rebelled against these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience during the first week or so we had no callers and i had begun to think that my companion was as friendless a man as i was myself presently however i found that he had many acquaintances and those in the most different classes of society there was one little sallow ratfaced darkeyed fellow who was introduced to me as mr lestrade and who came three or four times in a single week one morning a young girl called fashionably dressed and stayed for half an hour or more the same afternoon brought a greyheaded seedy visitor looking like a jew pedlar who appeared to me to be much excited and who was closely followed by a slipshod elderly woman on another occasion an old whitehaired gentleman had an interview with my companion and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform when any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance sherlock holmes used to beg for the use of the sittingroom and i would retire to my bedroom he always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience  i have to use this room as a place of business  he said  and these people are my clients  again i had an opportunity of asking him a point blank question and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me i imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for not alluding to it but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject of his own accord it was upon the 4th of march as i have good reason to remember that i rose somewhat earlier than usual and found that sherlock holmes had not yet finished his breakfast the landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared with the unreasonable petulance of mankind i rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that i was ready then i picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it while my companion munched silently at his toast one of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading and i naturally began to run my eye through it its somewhat ambitious title was  the book of life  and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way it struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity the reasoning was close and intense but the deductions appeared to me to be farfetched and exaggerated the writer claimed by a momentary expression a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye to fathom a man s inmost thoughts deceit according to him was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis his conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of euclid so startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer  from a drop of water  said the writer  a logician could infer the possibility of an atlantic or a niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other so all life is a great chain the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it like all other arts the science of deduction and analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems let him on meeting a fellowmortal learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man and the trade or profession to which he belongs puerile as such an exercise may seem it sharpens the faculties of observation and teaches one where to look and what to look for by a man s finger nails by his coatsleeve by his boot by his trouser knees by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb by his expression by his shirt cuffs by each of these things a man s calling is plainly revealed that all united should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable   what ineffable twaddle!  i cried slapping the magazine down on the table  i never read such rubbish in my life   what is it?  asked sherlock holmes  why this article  i said pointing at it with my egg spoon as i sat down to my breakfast  i see that you have read it since you have marked it i don t deny that it is smartly written it irritates me though it is evidently the theory of some armchair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study it is not practical i should like to see him clapped down in a third class carriage on the underground and asked to give the trades of all his fellowtravellers i would lay a thousand to one against him   you would lose your money  sherlock holmes remarked calmly  as for the article i wrote it myself   you!   yes i have a turn both for observation and for deduction the theories which i have expressed there and which appear to you to be so chimerical are really extremely practical so practical that i depend upon them for my bread and cheese   and how?  i asked involuntarily  well i have a trade of my own i suppose i am the only one in the world i m a consulting detective if you can understand what that is here in london we have lots of government detectives and lots of private ones when these fellows are at fault they come to me and i manage to put them on the right scent they lay all the evidence before me and i am generally able by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime to set them straight there is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger ends it is odd if you can t unravel the thousand and first lestrade is a wellknown detective he got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case and that was what brought him here   and these other people?   they are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies they are all people who are in trouble about something and want a little enlightening i listen to their story they listen to my comments and then i pocket my fee   but do you mean to say  i said  that without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of although they have seen every detail for themselves?   quite so i have a kind of intuition that way now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex then i have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes you see i have a lot of special knowledge which i apply to the problem and which facilitates matters wonderfully those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn are invaluable to me in practical work observation with me is second nature you appeared to be surprised when i told you on our first meeting that you had come from afghanistan   you were told no doubt   nothing of the sort i _knew_ you came from afghanistan from long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind that i arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps there were such steps however the train of reasoning ran  here is a gentleman of a medical type but with the air of a military man clearly an army doctor then he has just come from the tropics for his face is dark and that is not the natural tint of his skin for his wrists are fair he has undergone hardship and sickness as his haggard face says clearly his left arm has been injured he holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner where in the tropics could an english army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? clearly in afghanistan  the whole train of thought did not occupy a second i then remarked that you came from afghanistan and you were astonished   it is simple enough as you explain it  i said smiling  you remind me of edgar allen poe s dupin i had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories  sherlock holmes rose and lit his pipe  no doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to dupin  he observed  now in my opinion dupin was a very inferior fellow that trick of his of breaking in on his friends  thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour s silence is really very showy and superficial he had some analytical genius no doubt but he was by no means such a phenomenon as poe appeared to imagine   have you read gaboriau s works?  i asked  does lecoq come up to your idea of a detective?  sherlock holmes sniffed sardonically  lecoq was a miserable bungler  he said in an angry voice  he had only one thing to recommend him and that was his energy that book made me positively ill the question was how to identify an unknown prisoner i could have done it in twentyfour hours lecoq took six months or so it might be made a textbook for detectives to teach them what to avoid  i felt rather indignant at having two characters whom i had admired treated in this cavalier style i walked over to the window and stood looking out into the busy street  this fellow may be very clever  i said to myself  but he is certainly very conceited   there are no crimes and no criminals in these days  he said querulously  what is the use of having brains in our profession i know well that i have it in me to make my name famous no man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which i have done and what is the result? there is no crime to detect or at most some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a scotland yard official can see through it  i was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation i thought it best to change the topic  i wonder what that fellow is looking for?  i asked pointing to a stalwart plainlydressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street looking anxiously at the numbers he had a large blue envelope in his hand and was evidently the bearer of a message  you mean the retired sergeant of marines  said sherlock holmes  brag and bounce!  thought i to myself  he knows that i cannot verify his guess  the thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were watching caught sight of the number on our door and ran rapidly across the roadway we heard a loud knock a deep voice below and heavy steps ascending the stair  for mr sherlock holmes  he said stepping into the room and handing my friend the letter here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him he little thought of this when he made that random shot  may i ask my lad  i said in the blandest voice  what your trade may be?   commissionaire sir  he said gruffly  uniform away for repairs   and you were?  i asked with a slightly malicious glance at my companion  a sergeant sir royal marine light infantry sir no answer? right sir  he clicked his heels together raised his hand in a salute and was gone chapter iii the lauriston gardens mystery i confess that i was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companion s theories my respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously there still remained some lurking suspicion in my mind however that the whole thing was a prearranged episode intended to dazzle me though what earthly object he could have in taking me in was past my comprehension when i looked at him he had finished reading the note and his eyes had assumed the vacant lacklustre expression which showed mental abstraction  how in the world did you deduce that?  i asked  deduce what?  said he petulantly  why that he was a retired sergeant of marines   i have no time for trifles  he answered brusquely then with a smile  excuse my rudeness you broke the thread of my thoughts but perhaps it is as well so you actually were not able to see that that man was a sergeant of marines?   no indeed   it was easier to know it than to explain why i knew it if you were asked to prove that two and two made four you might find some difficulty and yet you are quite sure of the fact even across the street i could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the fellow s hand that smacked of the sea he had a military carriage however and regulation side whiskers there we have the marine he was a man with some amount of selfimportance and a certain air of command you must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his cane a steady respectable middleaged man too on the face of him all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant   wonderful!  i ejaculated  commonplace  said holmes though i thought from his expression that he was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration  i said just now that there were no criminals it appears that i am wrong look at this!  he threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought  why  i cried as i cast my eye over it  this is terrible!   it does seem to be a little out of the common  he remarked calmly  would you mind reading it to me aloud?  this is the letter which i read to him   my dear mr sherlock holmes   there has been a bad business during the night at 3 lauriston gardens off the brixton road our man on the beat saw a light there about two in the morning and as the house was an empty one suspected that something was amiss he found the door open and in the front room which is bare of furniture discovered the body of a gentleman well dressed and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of  enoch j drebber cleveland ohio usa  there had been no robbery nor is there any evidence as to how the man met his death there are marks of blood in the room but there is no wound upon his person we are at a loss as to how he came into the empty house indeed the whole affair is a puzzler if you can come round to the house any time before twelve you will find me there i have left everything _in statu quo_ until i hear from you if you are unable to come i shall give you fuller details and would esteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion yours faithfully  tobias gregson   gregson is the smartest of the scotland yarders  my friend remarked  he and lestrade are the pick of a bad lot they are both quick and energetic but conventional shockingly so they have their knives into one another too they are as jealous as a pair of professional beauties there will be some fun over this case if they are both put upon the scent  i was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on  surely there is not a moment to be lost  i cried  shall i go and order you a cab?   i m not sure about whether i shall go i am the most incurably lazy devil that ever stood in shoe leather that is when the fit is on me for i can be spry enough at times   why it is just such a chance as you have been longing for   my dear fellow what does it matter to me supposing i unravel the whole matter you may be sure that gregson lestrade and co will pocket all the credit that comes of being an unofficial personage   but he begs you to help him   yes he knows that i am his superior and acknowledges it to me but he would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person however we may as well go and have a look i shall work it out on my own hook i may have a laugh at them if i have nothing else come on!  he hustled on his overcoat and bustled about in a way that showed that an energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one  get your hat  he said  you wish me to come?   yes if you have nothing better to do  a minute later we were both in a hansom driving furiously for the brixton road it was a foggy cloudy morning and a duncoloured veil hung over the housetops looking like the reflection of the mudcoloured streets beneath my companion was in the best of spirits and prattled away about cremona fiddles and the difference between a stradivarius and an amati as for myself i was silent for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we were engaged depressed my spirits  you don t seem to give much thought to the matter in hand  i said at last interrupting holmes  musical disquisition  no data yet  he answered  it is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence it biases the judgment   you will have your data soon  i remarked pointing with my finger  this is the brixton road and that is the house if i am not very much mistaken   so it is stop driver stop!  we were still a hundred yards or so from it but he insisted upon our alighting and we finished our journey upon foot number 3 lauriston gardens wore an illomened and minatory look it was one of four which stood back some little way from the street two being occupied and two empty the latter looked out with three tiers of vacant melancholy windows which were blank and dreary save that here and there a  to let  card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared panes a small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street and was traversed by a narrow pathway yellowish in colour and consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel the whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night the garden was bounded by a threefoot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable surrounded by a small knot of loafers who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within i had imagined that sherlock holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery nothing appeared to be further from his intention with an air of nonchalance which under the circumstances seemed to me to border upon affectation he lounged up and down the pavement and gazed vacantly at the ground the sky the opposite houses and the line of railings having finished his scrutiny he proceeded slowly down the path or rather down the fringe of grass which flanked the path keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground twice he stopped and once i saw him smile and heard him utter an exclamation of satisfaction there were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil but since the police had been coming and going over it i was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it still i had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties that i had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from me at the door of the house we were met by a tall whitefaced flaxenhaired man with a notebook in his hand who rushed forward and wrung my companion s hand with effusion  it is indeed kind of you to come  he said  i have had everything left untouched   except that!  my friend answered pointing at the pathway  if a herd of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess no doubt however you had drawn your own conclusions gregson before you permitted this   i have had so much to do inside the house  the detective said evasively  my colleague mr lestrade is here i had relied upon him to look after this  holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically  with two such men as yourself and lestrade upon the ground there will not be much for a third party to find out  he said gregson rubbed his hands in a selfsatisfied way  i think we have done all that can be done  he answered  it s a queer case though and i knew your taste for such things   you did not come here in a cab?  asked sherlock holmes  no sir   nor lestrade?   no sir   then let us go and look at the room  with which inconsequent remark he strode on into the house followed by gregson whose features expressed his astonishment a short passage bare planked and dusty led to the kitchen and offices two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right one of these had obviously been closed for many weeks the other belonged to the diningroom which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred holmes walked in and i followed him with that subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires it was a large square room looking all the larger from the absence of all furniture a vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls but it was blotched in places with mildew and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down exposing the yellow plaster beneath opposite the door was a showy fireplace surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble on one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle the solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain giving a dull grey tinge to everything which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment all these details i observed afterwards at present my attention was centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling it was that of a man about fortythree or fortyfour years of age middlesized broad shouldered with crisp curling black hair and a short stubbly beard he was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat with lightcoloured trousers and immaculate collar and cuffs a top hat well brushed and trim was placed upon the floor beside him his hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one on his rigid face there stood an expression of horror and as it seemed to me of hatred such as i have never seen upon human features this malignant and terrible contortion combined with the low forehead blunt nose and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and apelike appearance which was increased by his writhing unnatural posture i have seen death in many forms but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban london lestrade lean and ferretlike as ever was standing by the doorway and greeted my companion and myself  this case will make a stir sir  he remarked  it beats anything i have seen and i am no chicken   there is no clue?  said gregson  none at all  chimed in lestrade sherlock holmes approached the body and kneeling down examined it intently  you are sure that there is no wound?  he asked pointing to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round  positive!  cried both detectives  then of course this blood belongs to a second individual presumably the murderer if murder has been committed it reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of van jansen in utrecht in the year  34 do you remember the case gregson?   no sir   read it up you really should there is nothing new under the sun it has all been done before  as he spoke his nimble fingers were flying here there and everywhere feeling pressing unbuttoning examining while his eyes wore the same faraway expression which i have already remarked upon so swiftly was the examination made that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness with which it was conducted finally he sniffed the dead man s lips and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots  he has not been moved at all?  he asked  no more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination   you can take him to the mortuary now  he said  there is nothing more to be learned  gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand at his call they entered the room and the stranger was lifted and carried out as they raised him a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes  there s been a woman here  he cried  it s a woman s weddingring  he held it out as he spoke upon the palm of his hand we all gathered round him and gazed at it there could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride  this complicates matters  said gregson  heaven knows they were complicated enough before   you re sure it doesn t simplify them?  observed holmes  there s nothing to be learned by staring at it what did you find in his pockets?   we have it all here  said gregson pointing to a litter of objects upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs  a gold watch no 97163 by barraud of london gold albert chain very heavy and solid gold ring with masonic device gold pin bulldog s head with rubies as eyes russian leather cardcase with cards of enoch j drebber of cleveland corresponding with the e j d upon the linen no purse but loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen pocket edition of boccaccio s _decameron_ with name of joseph stangerson upon the flyleaf two letters one addressed to e j drebber and one to joseph stangerson   at what address?   american exchange strand to be left till called for they are both from the guion steamship company and refer to the sailing of their boats from liverpool it is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return to new york   have you made any inquiries as to this man stangerson?   i did it at once sir  said gregson  i have had advertisements sent to all the newspapers and one of my men has gone to the american exchange but he has not returned yet   have you sent to cleveland?   we telegraphed this morning   how did you word your inquiries?   we simply detailed the circumstances and said that we should be glad of any information which could help us   you did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to be crucial?   i asked about stangerson   nothing else? is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears to hinge? will you not telegraph again?   i have said all i have to say  said gregson in an offended voice sherlock holmes chuckled to himself and appeared to be about to make some remark when lestrade who had been in the front room while we were holding this conversation in the hall reappeared upon the scene rubbing his hands in a pompous and selfsatisfied manner  mr gregson  he said  i have just made a discovery of the highest importance and one which would have been overlooked had i not made a careful examination of the walls  the little man s eyes sparkled as he spoke and he was evidently in a state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his colleague  come here  he said bustling back into the room the atmosphere of which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate  now stand there!  he struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall  look at that!  he said triumphantly i have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts in this particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off leaving a yellow square of coarse plastering across this bare space there was scrawled in bloodred letters a single word  rache  what do you think of that?  cried the detective with the air of a showman exhibiting his show  this was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner of the room and no one thought of looking there the murderer has written it with his or her own blood see this smear where it has trickled down the wall! that disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow why was that corner chosen to write it on? i will tell you see that candle on the mantelpiece it was lit at the time and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall   and what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?  asked gregson in a depreciatory voice  mean? why it means that the writer was going to put the female name rachel but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish you mark my words when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a woman named rachel has something to do with it it s all very well for you to laugh mr sherlock holmes you may be very smart and clever but the old hound is the best when all is said and done   i really beg your pardon!  said my companion who had ruffled the little man s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter  you certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out and as you say it bears every mark of having been written by the other participant in last night s mystery i have not had time to examine this room yet but with your permission i shall do so now  as he spoke he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying glass from his pocket with these two implements he trotted noiselessly about the room sometimes stopping occasionally kneeling and once lying flat upon his face so engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our presence for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time keeping up a running fire of exclamations groans whistles and little cries suggestive of encouragement and of hope as i watched him i was irresistibly reminded of a pureblooded welltrained foxhound as it dashes backwards and forwards through the covert whining in its eagerness until it comes across the lost scent for twenty minutes or more he continued his researches measuring with the most exact care the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me and occasionally applying his tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner in one place he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor and packed it away in an envelope finally he examined with his glass the word upon the wall going over every letter of it with the most minute exactness this done he appeared to be satisfied for he replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket  they say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains  he remarked with a smile  it s a very bad definition but it does apply to detective work  gregson and lestrade had watched the man uvres of their amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt they evidently failed to appreciate the fact which i had begun to realize that sherlock holmes  smallest actions were all directed towards some definite and practical end  what do you think of it sir?  they both asked  it would be robbing you of the credit of the case if i was to presume to help you  remarked my friend  you are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere  there was a world of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke  if you will let me know how your investigations go  he continued  i shall be happy to give you any help i can in the meantime i should like to speak to the constable who found the body can you give me his name and address?  lestrade glanced at his notebook  john rance  he said  he is off duty now you will find him at 46 audley court kennington park gate  holmes took a note of the address  come along doctor  he said  we shall go and look him up i ll tell you one thing which may help you in the case  he continued turning to the two detectives  there has been murder done and the murderer was a man he was more than six feet high was in the prime of life had small feet for his height wore coarse squaretoed boots and smoked a trichinopoly cigar he came here with his victim in a fourwheeled cab which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg in all probability the murderer had a florid face and the fingernails of his right hand were remarkably long these are only a few indications but they may assist you  lestrade and gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile  if this man was murdered how was it done?  asked the former  poison  said sherlock holmes curtly and strode off  one other thing lestrade  he added turning round at the door  rache  is the german for  revenge  so don t lose your time looking for miss rachel  with which parthian shot he walked away leaving the two rivals openmouthed behind him chapter iv what john rance had to tell it was one o clock when we left no 3 lauriston gardens sherlock holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office whence he dispatched a long telegram he then hailed a cab and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by lestrade  there is nothing like first hand evidence  he remarked  as a matter of fact my mind is entirely made up upon the case but still we may as well learn all that is to be learned   you amaze me holmes  said i  surely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave   there s no room for a mistake  he answered  the very first thing which i observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb now up to last night we have had no rain for a week so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night there were the marks of the horse s hoofs too the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three showing that that was a new shoe since the cab was there after the rain began and was not there at any time during the morning i have gregson s word for that it follows that it must have been there during the night and therefore that it brought those two individuals to the house   that seems simple enough  said i  but how about the other man s height?   why the height of a man in nine cases out of ten can be told from the length of his stride it is a simple calculation enough though there is no use my boring you with figures i had this fellow s stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within then i had a way of checking my calculation when a man writes on a wall his instinct leads him to write about the level of his own eyes now that writing was just over six feet from the ground it was child s play   and his age?  i asked  well if a man can stride four and ahalf feet without the smallest effort he can t be quite in the sere and yellow that was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across patentleather boots had gone round and squaretoes had hopped over there is no mystery about it at all i am simply applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which i advocated in that article is there anything else that puzzles you?   the finger nails and the trichinopoly  i suggested  the writing on the wall was done with a man s forefinger dipped in blood my glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it which would not have been the case if the man s nail had been trimmed i gathered up some scattered ash from the floor it was dark in colour and flakey such an ash as is only made by a trichinopoly i have made a special study of cigar ashes in fact i have written a monograph upon the subject i flatter myself that i can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand either of cigar or of tobacco it is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the gregson and lestrade type   and the florid face?  i asked  ah that was a more daring shot though i have no doubt that i was right you must not ask me that at the present state of the affair  i passed my hand over my brow  my head is in a whirl  i remarked  the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows how came these two men if there were two men into an empty house? what has become of the cabman who drove them? how could one man compel another to take poison? where did the blood come from? what was the object of the murderer since robbery had no part in it? how came the woman s ring there? above all why should the second man write up the german word rache before decamping? i confess that i cannot see any possible way of reconciling all these facts  my companion smiled approvingly  you sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well  he said  there is much that is still obscure though i have quite made up my mind on the main facts as to poor lestrade s discovery it was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track by suggesting socialism and secret societies it was not done by a german the a if you noticed was printed somewhat after the german fashion now a real german invariably prints in the latin character so that we may safely say that this was not written by one but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part it was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel i m not going to tell you much more of the case doctor you know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick and if i show you too much of my method of working you will come to the conclusion that i am a very ordinary individual after all   i shall never do that  i answered  you have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world  my companion flushed up with pleasure at my words and the earnest way in which i uttered them i had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty  i ll tell you one other thing  he said  patentleathers and squaretoes came in the same cab and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as possible arminarm in all probability when they got inside they walked up and down the room or rather patentleathers stood still while squaretoes walked up and down i could read all that in the dust and i could read that as he walked he grew more and more excited that is shown by the increased length of his strides he was talking all the while and working himself up no doubt into a fury then the tragedy occurred i ve told you all i know myself now for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture we have a good working basis however on which to start we must hurry up for i want to go to halle s concert to hear norman neruda this afternoon  this conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary byways in the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand  that s audley court in there  he said pointing to a narrow slit in the line of deadcoloured brick  you ll find me here when you come back  audley court was not an attractive locality the narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings we picked our way among groups of dirty children and through lines of discoloured linen until we came to number 46 the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name rance was engraved on enquiry we found that the constable was in bed and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming he appeared presently looking a little irritable at being disturbed in his slumbers  i made my report at the office  he said holmes took a halfsovereign from his pocket and played with it pensively  we thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips  he said  i shall be most happy to tell you anything i can  the constable answered with his eyes upon the little golden disk  just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred  rance sat down on the horsehair sofa and knitted his brows as though determined not to omit anything in his narrative  i ll tell it ye from the beginning  he said  my time is from ten at night to six in the morning at eleven there was a fight at the  white hart  but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat at one o clock it began to rain and i met harry murcher him who has the holland grove beat and we stood together at the corner of henrietta street atalkin  presently maybe about two or a little after i thought i would take a look round and see that all was right down the brixton road it was precious dirty and lonely not a soul did i meet all the way down though a cab or two went past me i was a strollin  down thinkin  between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same house now i knew that them two houses in lauriston gardens was empty on account of him that owns them who won t have the drains seen to though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o  typhoid fever i was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the window and i suspected as something was wrong when i got to the door   you stopped and then walked back to the garden gate  my companion interrupted  what did you do that for?  rance gave a violent jump and stared at sherlock holmes with the utmost amazement upon his features  why that s true sir  he said  though how you come to know it heaven only knows ye see when i got up to the door it was so still and so lonesome that i thought i d be none the worse for some one with me i ain t afeared of anything on this side o  the grave but i thought that maybe it was him that died o  the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him the thought gave me a kind o  turn and i walked back to the gate to see if i could see murcher s lantern but there wasn t no sign of him nor of anyone else   there was no one in the street?   not a livin  soul sir nor as much as a dog then i pulled myself together and went back and pushed the door open all was quiet inside so i went into the room where the light was aburnin  there was a candle flickerin  on the mantelpiece a red wax one and by its light i saw   yes i know all that you saw you walked round the room several times and you knelt down by the body and then you walked through and tried the kitchen door and then  john rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in his eyes  where was you hid to see all that?  he cried  it seems to me that you knows a deal more than you should  holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable  don t get arresting me for the murder  he said  i am one of the hounds and not the wolf mr gregson or mr lestrade will answer for that go on though what did you do next?  rance resumed his seat without however losing his mystified expression  i went back to the gate and sounded my whistle that brought murcher and two more to the spot   was the street empty then?   well it was as far as anybody that could be of any good goes   what do you mean?  the constable s features broadened into a grin  i ve seen many a drunk chap in my time  he said  but never anyone so cryin  drunk as that cove he was at the gate when i came out aleanin  up agin the railings and asingin  at the pitch o  his lungs about columbine s newfangled banner or some such stuff he couldn t stand far less help   what sort of a man was he?  asked sherlock holmes john rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression  he was an uncommon drunk sort o  man  he said  he d ha  found hisself in the station if we hadn t been so took up   his face his dress didn t you notice them?  holmes broke in impatiently  i should think i did notice them seeing that i had to prop him up me and murcher between us he was a long chap with a red face the lower part muffled round   that will do  cried holmes  what became of him?   we d enough to do without lookin  after him  the policeman said in an aggrieved voice  i ll wager he found his way home all right   how was he dressed?   a brown overcoat   had he a whip in his hand?   a whip no   he must have left it behind  muttered my companion  you didn t happen to see or hear a cab after that?   no   there s a halfsovereign for you  my companion said standing up and taking his hat  i am afraid rance that you will never rise in the force that head of yours should be for use as well as ornament you might have gained your sergeant s stripes last night the man whom you held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery and whom we are seeking there is no use of arguing about it now i tell you that it is so come along doctor  we started off for the cab together leaving our informant incredulous but obviously uncomfortable  the blundering fool  holmes said bitterly as we drove back to our lodgings  just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good luck and not taking advantage of it   i am rather in the dark still it is true that the description of this man tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery but why should he come back to the house after leaving it? that is not the way of criminals   the ring man the ring that was what he came back for if we have no other way of catching him we can always bait our line with the ring i shall have him doctor i ll lay you two to one that i have him i must thank you for it all i might not have gone but for you and so have missed the finest study i ever came across a study in scarlet eh? why shouldn t we use a little art jargon there s the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life and our duty is to unravel it and isolate it and expose every inch of it and now for lunch and then for norman neruda her attack and her bowing are splendid what s that little thing of chopin s she plays so magnificently tralalaliraliralay  leaning back in the cab this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a lark while i meditated upon the manysidedness of the human mind chapter v our advertisement brings a visitor our morning s exertions had been too much for my weak health and i was tired out in the afternoon after holmes  departure for the concert i lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours  sleep it was a useless attempt my mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it every time that i closed my eyes i saw before me the distorted baboonlike countenance of the murdered man so sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that i found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its owner from the world if ever human features bespoke vice of the most malignant type they were certainly those of enoch j drebber of cleveland still i recognized that justice must be done and that the depravity of the victim was no condonement in the eyes of the law the more i thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion s hypothesis that the man had been poisoned appear i remembered how he had sniffed his lips and had no doubt that he had detected something which had given rise to the idea then again if not poison what had caused the man s death since there was neither wound nor marks of strangulation? but on the other hand whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor? there were no signs of a struggle nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist as long as all these questions were unsolved i felt that sleep would be no easy matter either for holmes or myself his quiet selfconfident manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained all the facts though what it was i could not for an instant conjecture he was very late in returning so late that i knew that the concert could not have detained him all the time dinner was on the table before he appeared  it was magnificent  he said as he took his seat  do you remember what darwin says about music? he claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it there are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood   that s rather a broad idea  i remarked  one s ideas must be as broad as nature if they are to interpret nature  he answered  what s the matter? you re not looking quite yourself this brixton road affair has upset you   to tell the truth it has  i said  i ought to be more casehardened after my afghan experiences i saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at maiwand without losing my nerve   i can understand there is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination where there is no imagination there is no horror have you seen the evening paper?   no   it gives a fairly good account of the affair it does not mention the fact that when the man was raised up a woman s wedding ring fell upon the floor it is just as well it does not   why?   look at this advertisement  he answered  i had one sent to every paper this morning immediately after the affair  he threw the paper across to me and i glanced at the place indicated it was the first announcement in the  found  column  in brixton road this morning  it ran  a plain gold wedding ring found in the roadway between the  white hart  tavern and holland grove apply dr watson 221b baker street between eight and nine this evening   excuse my using your name  he said  if i used my own some of these dunderheads would recognize it and want to meddle in the affair   that is all right  i answered  but supposing anyone applies i have no ring   oh yes you have  said he handing me one  this will do very well it is almost a facsimile   and who do you expect will answer this advertisement   why the man in the brown coat our florid friend with the square toes if he does not come himself he will send an accomplice   would he not consider it as too dangerous?   not at all if my view of the case is correct and i have every reason to believe that it is this man would rather risk anything than lose the ring according to my notion he dropped it while stooping over drebber s body and did not miss it at the time after leaving the house he discovered his loss and hurried back but found the police already in possession owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning he had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate now put yourself in that man s place on thinking the matter over it must have occurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving the house what would he do then? he would eagerly look out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found his eye of course would light upon this he would be overjoyed why should he fear a trap? there would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder he would come he will come you shall see him within an hour?   and then?  i asked  oh you can leave me to deal with him then have you any arms?   i have my old service revolver and a few cartridges   you had better clean it and load it he will be a desperate man and though i shall take him unawares it is as well to be ready for anything  i went to my bedroom and followed his advice when i returned with the pistol the table had been cleared and holmes was engaged in his favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin  the plot thickens  he said as i entered  i have just had an answer to my american telegram my view of the case is the correct one   and that is?  i asked eagerly  my fiddle would be the better for new strings  he remarked  put your pistol in your pocket when the fellow comes speak to him in an ordinary way leave the rest to me don t frighten him by looking at him too hard   it is eight o clock now  i said glancing at my watch  yes he will probably be here in a few minutes open the door slightly that will do now put the key on the inside thank you! this is a queer old book i picked up at a stall yesterday de jure inter gentes published in latin at liege in the lowlands in 1642 charles  head was still firm on his shoulders when this little brownbacked volume was struck off   who is the printer?   philippe de croy whoever he may have been on the flyleaf in very faded ink is written  ex libris guliolmi whyte  i wonder who william whyte was some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer i suppose his writing has a legal twist about it here comes our man i think  as he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell sherlock holmes rose softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door we heard the servant pass along the hall and the sharp click of the latch as she opened it  does dr watson live here?  asked a clear but rather harsh voice we could not hear the servant s reply but the door closed and some one began to ascend the stairs the footfall was an uncertain and shuffling one a look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he listened to it it came slowly along the passage and there was a feeble tap at the door  come in  i cried at my summons instead of the man of violence whom we expected a very old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment she appeared to be dazzled by the sudden blaze of light and after dropping a curtsey she stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket with nervous shaky fingers i glanced at my companion and his face had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all i could do to keep my countenance the old crone drew out an evening paper and pointed at our advertisement  it s this as has brought me good gentlemen  she said dropping another curtsey  a gold wedding ring in the brixton road it belongs to my girl sally as was married only this time twelvemonth which her husband is steward aboard a union boat and what he d say if he come  ome and found her without her ring is more than i can think he being short enough at the best o  times but more especially when he has the drink if it please you she went to the circus last night along with   is that her ring?  i asked  the lord be thanked!  cried the old woman  sally will be a glad woman this night that s the ring   and what may your address be?  i inquired taking up a pencil  13 duncan street houndsditch a weary way from here   the brixton road does not lie between any circus and houndsditch  said sherlock holmes sharply the old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little redrimmed eyes  the gentleman asked me for _my_ address  she said  sally lives in lodgings at 3 mayfield place peckham   and your name is ?   my name is sawyer her s is dennis which tom dennis married her and a smart clean lad too as long as he s at sea and no steward in the company more thought of but when on shore what with the women and what with liquor shops   here is your ring mrs sawyer  i interrupted in obedience to a sign from my companion  it clearly belongs to your daughter and i am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner  with many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone packed it away in her pocket and shuffled off down the stairs sherlock holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into his room he returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and a cravat  i ll follow her  he said hurriedly  she must be an accomplice and will lead me to him wait up for me  the hall door had hardly slammed behind our visitor before holmes had descended the stair looking through the window i could see her walking feebly along the other side while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind  either his whole theory is incorrect  i thought to myself  or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery  there was no need for him to ask me to wait up for him for i felt that sleep was impossible until i heard the result of his adventure it was close upon nine when he set out i had no idea how long he might be but i sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of henri murger s  vie de boh me  ten o clock passed and i heard the footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed eleven and the more stately tread of the landlady passed my door bound for the same destination it was close upon twelve before i heard the sharp sound of his latchkey the instant he entered i saw by his face that he had not been successful amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the mastery until the former suddenly carried the day and he burst into a hearty laugh  i wouldn t have the scotland yarders know it for the world  he cried dropping into his chair  i have chaffed them so much that they would never have let me hear the end of it i can afford to laugh because i know that i will be even with them in the long run   what is it then?  i asked  oh i don t mind telling a story against myself that creature had gone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being footsore presently she came to a halt and hailed a fourwheeler which was passing i managed to be close to her so as to hear the address but i need not have been so anxious for she sang it out loud enough to be heard at the other side of the street  drive to 13 duncan street houndsditch  she cried this begins to look genuine i thought and having seen her safely inside i perched myself behind that s an art which every detective should be an expert at well away we rattled and never drew rein until we reached the street in question i hopped off before we came to the door and strolled down the street in an easy lounging way i saw the cab pull up the driver jumped down and i saw him open the door and stand expectantly nothing came out though when i reached him he was groping about frantically in the empty cab and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever i listened to there was no sign or trace of his passenger and i fear it will be some time before he gets his fare on inquiring at number 13 we found that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger named keswick and that no one of the name either of sawyer or dennis had ever been heard of there   you don t mean to say  i cried in amazement  that that tottering feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion without either you or the driver seeing her?   old woman be damned!  said sherlock holmes sharply  we were the old women to be so taken in it must have been a young man and an active one too besides being an incomparable actor the getup was inimitable he saw that he was followed no doubt and used this means of giving me the slip it shows that the man we are after is not as lonely as i imagined he was but has friends who are ready to risk something for him now doctor you are looking doneup take my advice and turn in  i was certainly feeling very weary so i obeyed his injunction i left holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire and long into the watches of the night i heard the low melancholy wailings of his violin and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he had set himself to unravel chapter vi tobias gregson shows what he can do the papers next day were full of the  brixton mystery  as they termed it each had a long account of the affair and some had leaders upon it in addition there was some information in them which was new to me i still retain in my scrapbook numerous clippings and extracts bearing upon the case here is a condensation of a few of them  the _daily telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features the german name of the victim the absence of all other motive and the sinister inscription on the wall all pointed to its perpetration by political refugees and revolutionists the socialists had many branches in america and the deceased had no doubt infringed their unwritten laws and been tracked down by them after alluding airily to the vehmgericht aqua tofana carbonari the marchioness de brinvilliers the darwinian theory the principles of malthus and the ratcliff highway murders the article concluded by admonishing the government and advocating a closer watch over foreigners in england the _standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort usually occurred under a liberal administration they arose from the unsettling of the minds of the masses and the consequent weakening of all authority the deceased was an american gentleman who had been residing for some weeks in the metropolis he had stayed at the boardinghouse of madame charpentier in torquay terrace camberwell he was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary mr joseph stangerson the two bade adieu to their landlady upon tuesday the 4th inst and departed to euston station with the avowed intention of catching the liverpool express they were afterwards seen together upon the platform nothing more is known of them until mr drebber s body was as recorded discovered in an empty house in the brixton road many miles from euston how he came there or how he met his fate are questions which are still involved in mystery nothing is known of the whereabouts of stangerson we are glad to learn that mr lestrade and mr gregson of scotland yard are both engaged upon the case and it is confidently anticipated that these wellknown officers will speedily throw light upon the matter the _daily news_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being a political one the despotism and hatred of liberalism which animated the continental governments had had the effect of driving to our shores a number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not soured by the recollection of all that they had undergone among these men there was a stringent code of honour any infringement of which was punished by death every effort should be made to find the secretary stangerson and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the deceased a great step had been gained by the discovery of the address of the house at which he had boarded a result which was entirely due to the acuteness and energy of mr gregson of scotland yard sherlock holmes and i read these notices over together at breakfast and they appeared to afford him considerable amusement  i told you that whatever happened lestrade and gregson would be sure to score   that depends on how it turns out   oh bless you it doesn t matter in the least if the man is caught it will be _on account_ of their exertions if he escapes it will be _in spite_ of their exertions it s heads i win and tails you lose whatever they do they will have followers  un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l admire   what on earth is this?  i cried for at this moment there came the pattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs accompanied by audible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady  it s the baker street division of the detective police force  said my companion gravely and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a dozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street arabs that ever i clapped eyes on  tention!  cried holmes in a sharp tone and the six dirty little scoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes  in future you shall send up wiggins alone to report and the rest of you must wait in the street have you found it wiggins?   no sir we hain t  said one of the youths  i hardly expected you would you must keep on until you do here are your wages  he handed each of them a shilling  now off you go and come back with a better report next time  he waved his hand and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street  there s more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than out of a dozen of the force  holmes remarked  the mere sight of an officiallooking person seals men s lips these youngsters however go everywhere and hear everything they are as sharp as needles too all they want is organisation   is it on this brixton case that you are employing them?  i asked  yes there is a point which i wish to ascertain it is merely a matter of time hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance! here is gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every feature of his face bound for us i know yes he is stopping there he is!  there was a violent peal at the bell and in a few seconds the fairhaired detective came up the stairs three steps at a time and burst into our sittingroom  my dear fellow  he cried wringing holmes  unresponsive hand  congratulate me! i have made the whole thing as clear as day  a shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion s expressive face  do you mean that you are on the right track?  he asked  the right track! why sir we have the man under lock and key   and his name is?   arthur charpentier sublieutenant in her majesty s navy  cried gregson pompously rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest sherlock holmes gave a sigh of relief and relaxed into a smile  take a seat and try one of these cigars  he said  we are anxious to know how you managed it will you have some whiskey and water?   i don t mind if i do  the detective answered  the tremendous exertions which i have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out not so much bodily exertion you understand as the strain upon the mind you will appreciate that mr sherlock holmes for we are both brainworkers   you do me too much honour  said holmes gravely  let us hear how you arrived at this most gratifying result  the detective seated himself in the armchair and puffed complacently at his cigar then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of amusement  the fun of it is  he cried  that that fool lestrade who thinks himself so smart has gone off upon the wrong track altogether he is after the secretary stangerson who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn i have no doubt that he has caught him by this time  the idea tickled gregson so much that he laughed until he choked  and how did you get your clue?   ah i ll tell you all about it of course doctor watson this is strictly between ourselves the first difficulty which we had to contend with was the finding of this american s antecedents some people would have waited until their advertisements were answered or until parties came forward and volunteered information that is not tobias gregson s way of going to work you remember the hat beside the dead man?   yes  said holmes  by john underwood and sons 129 camberwell road  gregson looked quite crestfallen  i had no idea that you noticed that  he said  have you been there?   no   ha!  cried gregson in a relieved voice  you should never neglect a chance however small it may seem   to a great mind nothing is little  remarked holmes sententiously  well i went to underwood and asked him if he had sold a hat of that size and description he looked over his books and came on it at once he had sent the hat to a mr drebber residing at charpentier s boarding establishment torquay terrace thus i got at his address   smart very smart!  murmured sherlock holmes  i next called upon madame charpentier  continued the detective  i found her very pale and distressed her daughter was in the room too an uncommonly fine girl she is too she was looking red about the eyes and her lips trembled as i spoke to her that didn t escape my notice i began to smell a rat you know the feeling mr sherlock holmes when you come upon the right scent a kind of thrill in your nerves  have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder mr enoch j drebber of cleveland?  i asked  the mother nodded she didn t seem able to get out a word the daughter burst into tears i felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter  at what o clock did mr drebber leave your house for the train?  i asked  at eight o clock  she said gulping in her throat to keep down her agitation  his secretary mr stangerson said that there were two trains one at 915 and one at 11 he was to catch the first   and was that the last which you saw of him?   a terrible change came over the woman s face as i asked the question her features turned perfectly livid it was some seconds before she could get out the single word  yes and when it did come it was in a husky unnatural tone  there was silence for a moment and then the daughter spoke in a calm clear voice  no good can ever come of falsehood mother  she said  let us be frank with this gentleman we _did_ see mr drebber again   god forgive you!  cried madame charpentier throwing up her hands and sinking back in her chair  you have murdered your brother   arthur would rather that we spoke the truth  the girl answered firmly  you had best tell me all about it now  i said  halfconfidences are worse than none besides you do not know how much we know of it   on your head be it alice!  cried her mother and then turning to me  i will tell you all sir do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this terrible affair he is utterly innocent of it my dread is however that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be compromised that however is surely impossible his high character his profession his antecedents would all forbid it   your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts  i answered  depend upon it if your son is innocent he will be none the worse   perhaps alice you had better leave us together  she said and her daughter withdrew  now sir  she continued  i had no intention of telling you all this but since my poor daughter has disclosed it i have no alternative having once decided to speak i will tell you all without omitting any particular   it is your wisest course  said i  mr drebber has been with us nearly three weeks he and his secretary mr stangerson had been travelling on the continent i noticed a  copenhagen  label upon each of their trunks showing that that had been their last stopping place stangerson was a quiet reserved man but his employer i am sorry to say was far otherwise he was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways the very night of his arrival he became very much the worse for drink and indeed after twelve o clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober his manners towards the maidservants were disgustingly free and familiar worst of all he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter alice and spoke to her more than once in a way which fortunately she is too innocent to understand on one occasion he actually seized her in his arms and embraced her an outrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct   but why did you stand all this  i asked  i suppose that you can get rid of your boarders when you wish   mrs charpentier blushed at my pertinent question  would to god that i had given him notice on the very day that he came  she said  but it was a sore temptation they were paying a pound a day each fourteen pounds a week and this is the slack season i am a widow and my boy in the navy has cost me much i grudged to lose the money i acted for the best this last was too much however and i gave him notice to leave on account of it that was the reason of his going   well?   my heart grew light when i saw him drive away my son is on leave just now but i did not tell him anything of all this for his temper is violent and he is passionately fond of his sister when i closed the door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind alas in less than an hour there was a ring at the bell and i learned that mr drebber had returned he was much excited and evidently the worse for drink he forced his way into the room where i was sitting with my daughter and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train he then turned to alice and before my very face proposed to her that she should fly with him  you are of age  he said  and there is no law to stop you i have money enough and to spare never mind the old girl here but come along with me now straight away you shall live like a princess  poor alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the door i screamed and at that moment my son arthur came into the room what happened then i do not know i heard oaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle i was too terrified to raise my head when i did look up i saw arthur standing in the doorway laughing with a stick in his hand  i don t think that fine fellow will trouble us again  he said  i will just go after him and see what he does with himself  with those words he took his hat and started off down the street the next morning we heard of mr drebber s mysterious death   this statement came from mrs charpentier s lips with many gasps and pauses at times she spoke so low that i could hardly catch the words i made shorthand notes of all that she said however so that there should be no possibility of a mistake   it s quite exciting  said sherlock holmes with a yawn  what happened next?   when mrs charpentier paused  the detective continued  i saw that the whole case hung upon one point fixing her with my eye in a way which i always found effective with women i asked her at what hour her son returned  i do not know  she answered  not know?   no he has a latchkey and he let himself in   after you went to bed?   yes   when did you go to bed?   about eleven   so your son was gone at least two hours?   yes   possibly four or five?   yes   what was he doing during that time?   i do not know  she answered turning white to her very lips  of course after that there was nothing more to be done i found out where lieutenant charpentier was took two officers with me and arrested him when i touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us he answered us as bold as brass  i suppose you are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel drebber  he said we had said nothing to him about it so that his alluding to it had a most suspicious aspect   very  said holmes  he still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as having with him when he followed drebber it was a stout oak cudgel   what is your theory then?   well my theory is that he followed drebber as far as the brixton road when there a fresh altercation arose between them in the course of which drebber received a blow from the stick in the pit of the stomach perhaps which killed him without leaving any mark the night was so wet that no one was about so charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house as to the candle and the blood and the writing on the wall and the ring they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent   well done!  said holmes in an encouraging voice  really gregson you are getting along we shall make something of you yet   i flatter myself that i have managed it rather neatly  the detective answered proudly  the young man volunteered a statement in which he said that after following drebber some time the latter perceived him and took a cab in order to get away from him on his way home he met an old shipmate and took a long walk with him on being asked where this old shipmate lived he was unable to give any satisfactory reply i think the whole case fits together uncommonly well what amuses me is to think of lestrade who had started off upon the wrong scent i am afraid he won t make much of it why by jove here s the very man himself!  it was indeed lestrade who had ascended the stairs while we were talking and who now entered the room the assurance and jauntiness which generally marked his demeanour and dress were however wanting his face was disturbed and troubled while his clothes were disarranged and untidy he had evidently come with the intention of consulting with sherlock holmes for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be embarrassed and put out he stood in the centre of the room fumbling nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do  this is a most extraordinary case  he said at last a most incomprehensible affair   ah you find it so mr lestrade!  cried gregson triumphantly  i thought you would come to that conclusion have you managed to find the secretary mr joseph stangerson?   the secretary mr joseph stangerson  said lestrade gravely  was murdered at halliday s private hotel about six o clock this morning  chapter vii light in the darkness the intelligence with which lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so unexpected that we were all three fairly dumfoundered gregson sprang out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water i stared in silence at sherlock holmes whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes  stangerson too!  he muttered  the plot thickens   it was quite thick enough before  grumbled lestrade taking a chair  i seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war   are you are you sure of this piece of intelligence?  stammered gregson  i have just come from his room  said lestrade  i was the first to discover what had occurred   we have been hearing gregson s view of the matter  holmes observed  would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?   i have no objection  lestrade answered seating himself  i freely confess that i was of the opinion that stangerson was concerned in the death of drebber this fresh development has shown me that i was completely mistaken full of the one idea i set myself to find out what had become of the secretary they had been seen together at euston station about halfpast eight on the evening of the third at two in the morning drebber had been found in the brixton road the question which confronted me was to find out how stangerson had been employed between 830 and the time of the crime and what had become of him afterwards i telegraphed to liverpool giving a description of the man and warning them to keep a watch upon the american boats i then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodginghouses in the vicinity of euston you see i argued that if drebber and his companion had become separated the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night and then to hang about the station again next morning   they would be likely to agree on some meetingplace beforehand  remarked holmes  so it proved i spent the whole of yesterday evening in making enquiries entirely without avail this morning i began very early and at eight o clock i reached halliday s private hotel in little george street on my enquiry as to whether a mr stangerson was living there they at once answered me in the affirmative  no doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting  they said  he has been waiting for a gentleman for two days   where is he now?  i asked  he is upstairs in bed he wished to be called at nine   i will go up and see him at once  i said  it seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him to say something unguarded the boots volunteered to show me the room it was on the second floor and there was a small corridor leading up to it the boots pointed out the door to me and was about to go downstairs again when i saw something that made me feel sickish in spite of my twenty years  experience from under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood which had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side i gave a cry which brought the boots back he nearly fainted when he saw it the door was locked on the inside but we put our shoulders to it and knocked it in the window of the room was open and beside the window all huddled up lay the body of a man in his nightdress he was quite dead and had been for some time for his limbs were rigid and cold when we turned him over the boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of joseph stangerson the cause of death was a deep stab in the left side which must have penetrated the heart and now comes the strangest part of the affair what do you suppose was above the murdered man?  i felt a creeping of the flesh and a presentiment of coming horror even before sherlock holmes answered  the word rache written in letters of blood  he said  that was it  said lestrade in an awestruck voice and we were all silent for a while there was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes my nerves which were steady enough on the field of battle tingled as i thought of it  the man was seen  continued lestrade  a milk boy passing on his way to the dairy happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel he noticed that a ladder which usually lay there was raised against one of the windows of the second floor which was wide open after passing he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder he came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel he took no particular notice of him beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work he has an impression that the man was tall had a reddish face and was dressed in a long brownish coat he must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder for we found bloodstained water in the basin where he had washed his hands and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife  i glanced at holmes on hearing the description of the murderer which tallied so exactly with his own there was however no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his face  did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer?  he asked  nothing stangerson had drebber s purse in his pocket but it seems that this was usual as he did all the paying there was eighty odd pounds in it but nothing had been taken whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes robbery is certainly not one of them there were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man s pocket except a single telegram dated from cleveland about a month ago and containing the words  j h is in europe  there was no name appended to this message   and there was nothing else?  holmes asked  nothing of any importance the man s novel with which he had read himself to sleep was lying upon the bed and his pipe was on a chair beside him there was a glass of water on the table and on the windowsill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills  sherlock holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight  the last link  he cried exultantly  my case is complete  the two detectives stared at him in amazement  i have now in my hands  my companion said confidently  all the threads which have formed such a tangle there are of course details to be filled in but i am as certain of all the main facts from the time that drebber parted from stangerson at the station up to the discovery of the body of the latter as if i had seen them with my own eyes i will give you a proof of my knowledge could you lay your hand upon those pills?   i have them  said lestrade producing a small white box  i took them and the purse and the telegram intending to have them put in a place of safety at the police station it was the merest chance my taking these pills for i am bound to say that i do not attach any importance to them   give them here  said holmes  now doctor  turning to me  are those ordinary pills?  they certainly were not they were of a pearly grey colour small round and almost transparent against the light  from their lightness and transparency i should imagine that they are soluble in water  i remarked  precisely so  answered holmes  now would you mind going down and fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday  i went downstairs and carried the dog upstairs in my arms its laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end indeed its snowwhite muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of canine existence i placed it upon a cushion on the rug  i will now cut one of these pills in two  said holmes and drawing his penknife he suited the action to the word  one half we return into the box for future purposes the other half i will place in this wine glass in which is a teaspoonful of water you perceive that our friend the doctor is right and that it readily dissolves   this may be very interesting  said lestrade in the injured tone of one who suspects that he is being laughed at  i cannot see however what it has to do with the death of mr joseph stangerson   patience my friend patience! you will find in time that it has everything to do with it i shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps it up readily enough  as he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier who speedily licked it dry sherlock holmes  earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence watching the animal intently and expecting some startling effect none such appeared however the dog continued to lie stretched upon the cushion breathing in a laboured way but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught holmes had taken out his watch and as minute followed minute without result an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features he gnawed his lip drummed his fingers upon the table and showed every other symptom of acute impatience so great was his emotion that i felt sincerely sorry for him while the two detectives smiled derisively by no means displeased at this check which he had met  it can t be a coincidence  he cried at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room  it is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence the very pills which i suspected in the case of drebber are actually found after the death of stangerson and yet they are inert what can it mean? surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have been false it is impossible! and yet this wretched dog is none the worse ah i have it! i have it!  with a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box cut the other pill in two dissolved it added milk and presented it to the terrier the unfortunate creature s tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning sherlock holmes drew a long breath and wiped the perspiration from his forehead  i should have more faith  he said  i ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison and the other was entirely harmless i ought to have known that before ever i saw the box at all  this last statement appeared to me to be so startling that i could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses there was the dead dog however to prove that his conjecture had been correct it seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away and i began to have a dim vague perception of the truth  all this seems strange to you  continued holmes  because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you i had the good fortune to seize upon that and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition and indeed was the logical sequence of it hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions it is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery the most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn this murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those _outr _ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable these strange details far from making the case more difficult have really had the effect of making it less so  mr gregson who had listened to this address with considerable impatience could contain himself no longer  look here mr sherlock holmes  he said  we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart man and that you have your own methods of working we want something more than mere theory and preaching now though it is a case of taking the man i have made my case out and it seems i was wrong young charpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair lestrade went after his man stangerson and it appears that he was wrong too you have thrown out hints here and hints there and seem to know more than we do but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business can you name the man who did it?   i cannot help feeling that gregson is right sir  remarked lestrade  we have both tried and we have both failed you have remarked more than once since i have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require surely you will not withhold it any longer   any delay in arresting the assassin  i observed  might give him time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity  thus pressed by us all holmes showed signs of irresolution he continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows drawn down as was his habit when lost in thought  there will be no more murders  he said at last stopping abruptly and facing us  you can put that consideration out of the question you have asked me if i know the name of the assassin i do the mere knowing of his name is a small thing however compared with the power of laying our hands upon him this i expect very shortly to do i have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements but it is a thing which needs delicate handling for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with who is supported as i have had occasion to prove by another who is as clever as himself as long as this man has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him but if he had the slightest suspicion he would change his name and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city without meaning to hurt either of your feelings i am bound to say that i consider these men to be more than a match for the official force and that is why i have not asked your assistance if i fail i shall of course incur all the blame due to this omission but that i am prepared for at present i am ready to promise that the instant that i can communicate with you without endangering my own combinations i shall do so  gregson and lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police the former had flushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair while the other s beady eyes glistened with curiosity and resentment neither of them had time to speak however before there was a tap at the door and the spokesman of the street arabs young wiggins introduced his insignificant and unsavoury person  please sir  he said touching his forelock  i have the cab downstairs   good boy  said holmes blandly  why don t you introduce this pattern at scotland yard?  he continued taking a pair of steel handcuffs from a drawer  see how beautifully the spring works they fasten in an instant   the old pattern is good enough  remarked lestrade  if we can only find the man to put them on   very good very good  said holmes smiling  the cabman may as well help me with my boxes just ask him to step up wiggins  i was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about to set out on a journey since he had not said anything to me about it there was a small portmanteau in the room and this he pulled out and began to strap he was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the room  just give me a help with this buckle cabman  he said kneeling over his task and never turning his head the fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen defiant air and put down his hands to assist at that instant there was a sharp click the jangling of metal and sherlock holmes sprang to his feet again  gentlemen  he cried with flashing eyes  let me introduce you to mr jefferson hope the murderer of enoch drebber and of joseph stangerson  the whole thing occurred in a moment so quickly that i had no time to realize it i have a vivid recollection of that instant of holmes  triumphant expression and the ring of his voice of the cabman s dazed savage face as he glared at the glittering handcuffs which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists for a second or two we might have been a group of statues then with an inarticulate roar of fury the prisoner wrenched himself free from holmes s grasp and hurled himself through the window woodwork and glass gave way before him but before he got quite through gregson lestrade and holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds he was dragged back into the room and then commenced a terrific conflict so powerful and so fierce was he that the four of us were shaken off again and again he appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit his face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance it was not until lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and halfstrangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands that done we rose to our feet breathless and panting  we have his cab  said sherlock holmes  it will serve to take him to scotland yard and now gentlemen  he continued with a pleasant smile  we have reached the end of our little mystery you are very welcome to put any questions that you like to me now and there is no danger that i will refuse to answer them  part ii _the country of the saints_ chapter i on the great alkali plain in the central portion of the great north american continent there lies an arid and repulsive desert which for many a long year served as a barrier against the advance of civilisation from the sierra nevada to nebraska and from the yellowstone river in the north to the colorado upon the south is a region of desolation and silence nor is nature always in one mood throughout this grim district it comprises snowcapped and lofty mountains and dark and gloomy valleys there are swiftflowing rivers which dash through jagged ca ons and there are enormous plains which in winter are white with snow and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust they all preserve however the common characteristics of barrenness inhospitality and misery there are no inhabitants of this land of despair a band of pawnees or of blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other huntinggrounds but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight of those awesome plains and to find themselves once more upon their prairies the coyote skulks among the scrub the buzzard flaps heavily through the air and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark ravines and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks these are the sole dwellers in the wilderness in the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the sierra blanco as far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plainland all dusted over with patches of alkali and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes on the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks with their rugged summits flecked with snow in this great stretch of country there is no sign of life nor of anything appertaining to life there is no bird in the steelblue heaven no movement upon the dull grey earth above all there is absolute silence listen as one may there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness nothing but silence complete and heartsubduing silence it has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain that is hardly true looking down from the sierra blanco one sees a pathway traced out across the desert which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance it is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali approach and examine them! they are bones some large and coarse others smaller and more delicate the former have belonged to oxen and the latter to men for fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside looking down on this very scene there stood upon the fourth of may eighteen hundred and fortyseven a solitary traveller his appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region an observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty his face was lean and haggard and the brown parchmentlike skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones his long brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white his eyes were sunken in his head and burned with an unnatural lustre while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton as he stood he leaned upon his weapon for support and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution his gaunt face however and his clothes which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance the man was dying dying from hunger and from thirst he had toiled painfully down the ravine and on to this little elevation in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water now the great salt plain stretched before his eyes and the distant belt of savage mountains without a sign anywhere of plant or tree which might indicate the presence of moisture in all that broad landscape there was no gleam of hope north and east and west he looked with wild questioning eyes and then he realised that his wanderings had come to an end and that there on that barren crag he was about to die  why not here as well as in a feather bed twenty years hence  he muttered as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder before sitting down he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl which he had carried slung over his right shoulder it appeared to be somewhat too heavy for his strength for in lowering it it came down on the ground with some little violence instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little moaning cry and from it there protruded a small scared face with very bright brown eyes and two little speckled dimpled fists  you ve hurt me!  said a childish voice reproachfully  have i though  the man answered penitently  i didn t go for to do it  as he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty little girl of about five years of age whose dainty shoes and smart pink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother s care the child was pale and wan but her healthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered less than her companion  how is it now?  he answered anxiously for she was still rubbing the towsy golden curls which covered the back of her head  kiss it and make it well  she said with perfect gravity showing the injured part up to him  that s what mother used to do where s mother?   mother s gone i guess you ll see her before long   gone eh!  said the little girl  funny she didn t say goodbye she  most always did if she was just goin  over to auntie s for tea and now she s been away three days say it s awful dry ain t it? ain t there no water nor nothing to eat?   no there ain t nothing dearie you ll just need to be patient awhile and then you ll be all right put your head up agin me like that and then you ll feel bullier it ain t easy to talk when your lips is like leather but i guess i d best let you know how the cards lie what s that you ve got?   pretty things! fine things!  cried the little girl enthusiastically holding up two glittering fragments of mica  when we goes back to home i ll give them to brother bob   you ll see prettier things than them soon  said the man confidently  you just wait a bit i was going to tell you though you remember when we left the river?   oh yes   well we reckoned we d strike another river soon d ye see but there was somethin  wrong compasses or map or somethin  and it didn t turn up water ran out just except a little drop for the likes of you and and   and you couldn t wash yourself  interrupted his companion gravely staring up at his grimy visage  no nor drink and mr bender he was the fust to go and then indian pete and then mrs mcgregor and then johnny hones and then dearie your mother   then mother s a deader too  cried the little girl dropping her face in her pinafore and sobbing bitterly  yes they all went except you and me then i thought there was some chance of water in this direction so i heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it together it don t seem as though we ve improved matters there s an almighty small chance for us now!   do you mean that we are going to die too?  asked the child checking her sobs and raising her tearstained face  i guess that s about the size of it   why didn t you say so before?  she said laughing gleefully  you gave me such a fright why of course now as long as we die we ll be with mother again   yes you will dearie   and you too i ll tell her how awful good you ve been i ll bet she meets us at the door of heaven with a big pitcher of water and a lot of buckwheat cakes hot and toasted on both sides like bob and me was fond of how long will it be first?   i don t know not very long  the man s eyes were fixed upon the northern horizon in the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks which increased in size every moment so rapidly did they approach they speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds which circled over the heads of the two wanderers and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them they were buzzards the vultures of the west whose coming is the forerunner of death  cocks and hens  cried the little girl gleefully pointing at their illomened forms and clapping her hands to make them rise  say did god make this country?   in course he did  said her companion rather startled by this unexpected question  he made the country down in illinois and he made the missouri  the little girl continued  i guess somebody else made the country in these parts it s not nearly so well done they forgot the water and the trees   what would ye think of offering up prayer?  the man asked diffidently  it ain t night yet  she answered  it don t matter it ain t quite regular but he won t mind that you bet you say over them ones that you used to say every night in the waggon when we was on the plains   why don t you say some yourself?  the child asked with wondering eyes  i disremember them  he answered  i hain t said none since i was half the height o  that gun i guess it s never too late you say them out and i ll stand by and come in on the choruses   then you ll need to kneel down and me too  she said laying the shawl out for that purpose  you ve got to put your hands up like this it makes you feel kind o  good  it was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see it side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers the little prattling child and the reckless hardened adventurer her chubby face and his haggard angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom they were face to face while the two voices the one thin and clear the other deep and harsh united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness the prayer finished they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep nestling upon the broad breast of her protector he watched over her slumber for some time but nature proved to be too strong for him for three days and three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose slowly the eyelids drooped over the tired eyes and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast until the man s grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight would have met his eyes far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rose up a little spray of dust very slight at first and hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance but gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid welldefined cloud this cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures in more fertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was approaching him this was obviously impossible in these arid wilds as the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing the canvascovered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze and the apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the west but what a caravan! when the head of it had reached the base of the mountains the rear was not yet visible on the horizon right across the enormous plain stretched the straggling array waggons and carts men on horseback and men on foot innumerable women who staggered along under burdens and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings this was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants but rather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new country there rose through the clear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of humanity with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses loud as it was it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above them at the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced men clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles on reaching the base of the bluff they halted and held a short council among themselves  the wells are to the right my brothers  said one a hardlipped cleanshaven man with grizzly hair  to the right of the sierra blanco so we shall reach the rio grande  said another  fear not for water  cried a third  he who could draw it from the rocks will not now abandon his own chosen people   amen! amen!  responded the whole party they were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and keenesteyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag above them from its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink showing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind at the sight there was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns while fresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard the word  redskins  was on every lip  there can t be any number of injuns here  said the elderly man who appeared to be in command  we have passed the pawnees and there are no other tribes until we cross the great mountains   shall i go forward and see brother stangerson  asked one of the band  and i   and i  cried a dozen voices  leave your horses below and we will await you here  the elder answered in a moment the young fellows had dismounted fastened their horses and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object which had excited their curiosity they advanced rapidly and noiselessly with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts the watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the skyline the young man who had first given the alarm was leading them suddenly his followers saw him throw up his hands as though overcome with astonishment and on joining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met their eyes on the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single giant boulder and against this boulder there lay a tall man longbearded and hardfeatured but of an excessive thinness his placid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep beside him lay a little child with her round white arms encircling his brown sinewy neck and her golden haired head resting upon the breast of his velveteen tunic her rosy lips were parted showing the regular line of snowwhite teeth within and a playful smile played over her infantile features her plump little white legs terminating in white socks and neat shoes with shining buckles offered a strange contrast to the long shrivelled members of her companion on the ledge of rock above this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards who at the sight of the new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away the cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about them in bewilderment the man staggered to his feet and looked down upon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him and which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts his face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed and he passed his boney hand over his eyes  this is what they call delirium i guess  he muttered the child stood beside him holding on to the skirt of his coat and said nothing but looked all round her with the wondering questioning gaze of childhood the rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that their appearance was no delusion one of them seized the little girl and hoisted her upon his shoulder while two others supported her gaunt companion and assisted him towards the waggons  my name is john ferrier  the wanderer explained  me and that little un are all that s left o  twentyone people the rest is all dead o  thirst and hunger away down in the south   is she your child?  asked someone  i guess she is now  the other cried defiantly  she s mine  cause i saved her no man will take her from me she s lucy ferrier from this day on who are you though?  he continued glancing with curiosity at his stalwart sunburned rescuers  there seems to be a powerful lot of ye   nigh upon ten thousand  said one of the young men  we are the persecuted children of god the chosen of the angel merona   i never heard tell on him  said the wanderer  he appears to have chosen a fair crowd of ye   do not jest at that which is sacred  said the other sternly  we are of those who believe in those sacred writings drawn in egyptian letters on plates of beaten gold which were handed unto the holy joseph smith at palmyra we have come from nauvoo in the state of illinois where we had founded our temple we have come to seek a refuge from the violent man and from the godless even though it be the heart of the desert  the name of nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to john ferrier  i see  he said  you are the mormons   we are the mormons  answered his companions with one voice  and where are you going?   we do not know the hand of god is leading us under the person of our prophet you must come before him he shall say what is to be done with you  they had reached the base of the hill by this time and were surrounded by crowds of the pilgrims palefaced meeklooking women strong laughing children and anxious earnesteyed men many were the cries of astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they perceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the other their escort did not halt however but pushed on followed by a great crowd of mormons until they reached a waggon which was conspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of its appearance six horses were yoked to it whereas the others were furnished with two or at most four apiece beside the driver there sat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age but whose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader he was reading a brownbacked volume but as the crowd approached he laid it aside and listened attentively to an account of the episode then he turned to the two castaways  if we take you with us  he said in solemn words  it can only be as believers in our own creed we shall have no wolves in our fold better far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the whole fruit will you come with us on these terms?   guess i ll come with you on any terms  said ferrier with such emphasis that the grave elders could not restrain a smile the leader alone retained his stern impressive expression  take him brother stangerson  he said  give him food and drink and the child likewise let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed we have delayed long enough forward! on on to zion!   on on to zion!  cried the crowd of mormons and the words rippled down the long caravan passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a dull murmur in the far distance with a cracking of whips and a creaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion and soon the whole caravan was winding along once more the elder to whose care the two waifs had been committed led them to his waggon where a meal was already awaiting them  you shall remain here  he said  in a few days you will have recovered from your fatigues in the meantime remember that now and for ever you are of our religion brigham young has said it and he has spoken with the voice of joseph smith which is the voice of god  chapter ii the flower of utah this is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured by the immigrant mormons before they came to their final haven from the shores of the mississippi to the western slopes of the rocky mountains they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history the savage man and the savage beast hunger thirst fatigue and disease every impediment which nature could place in the way had all been overcome with anglosaxon tenacity yet the long journey and the accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them there was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer when they saw the broad valley of utah bathed in the sunlight beneath them and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the promised land and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for evermore young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a resolute chief maps were drawn and charts prepared in which the future city was sketched out all around farms were apportioned and allotted in proportion to the standing of each individual the tradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling in the town streets and squares sprang up as if by magic in the country there was draining and hedging planting and clearing until the next summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop everything prospered in the strange settlement above all the great temple which they had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger from the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight the clatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the immigrants erected to him who had led them safe through many dangers the two castaways john ferrier and the little girl who had shared his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter accompanied the mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage little lucy ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in elder stangerson s waggon a retreat which she shared with the mormon s three wives and with his son a headstrong forward boy of twelve having rallied with the elasticity of childhood from the shock caused by her mother s death she soon became a pet with the women and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvascovered home in the meantime ferrier having recovered from his privations distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter so rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions that when they reached the end of their wanderings it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers with the exception of young himself and of stangerson kemball johnston and drebber who were the four principal elders on the farm thus acquired john ferrier built himself a substantial loghouse which received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy villa he was a man of a practical turn of mind keen in his dealings and skilful with his hands his iron constitution enabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his lands hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly in three years he was better off than his neighbours in six he was welltodo in nine he was rich and in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of salt lake city who could compare with him from the great inland sea to the distant wahsatch mountains there was no name better known than that of john ferrier there was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities of his coreligionists no argument or persuasion could ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions he never gave reasons for this persistent refusal but contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination there were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion and others who put it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense others again spoke of some early love affair and of a fairhaired girl who had pined away on the shores of the atlantic whatever the reason ferrier remained strictly celibate in every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young settlement and gained the name of being an orthodox and straightwalking man lucy ferrier grew up within the loghouse and assisted her adopted father in all his undertakings the keen air of the mountains and the balsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to the young girl as year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger her cheek more rudy and her step more elastic many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by ferrier s farm felt longforgotten thoughts revive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields or met her mounted upon her father s mustang and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the west so the bud blossomed into a flower and the year which saw her father the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of american girlhood as could be found in the whole pacific slope it was not the father however who first discovered that the child had developed into the woman it seldom is in such cases that mysterious change is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates least of all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her and she learns with a mixture of pride and of fear that a new and a larger nature has awoken within her there are few who cannot recall that day and remember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life in the case of lucy ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself apart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides it was a warm june morning and the latter day saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem in the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavilyladen mules all heading to the west for the gold fever had broken out in california and the overland route lay through the city of the elect there too were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands and trains of tired immigrants men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey through all this motley assemblage threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider there galloped lucy ferrier her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her she had a commission from her father in the city and was dashing in as she had done many a time before with all the fearlessness of youth thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed the travelstained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment and even the unemotional indians journeying in with their pelties relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the palefaced maiden she had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked by a great drove of cattle driven by a halfdozen wildlooking herdsmen from the plains in her impatience she endeavoured to pass this obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap scarcely had she got fairly into it however before the beasts closed in behind her and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of fierceeyed longhorned bullocks accustomed as she was to deal with cattle she was not alarmed at her situation but took advantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way through the cavalcade unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures either by accident or design came in violent contact with the flank of the mustang and excited it to madness in an instant it reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage and pranced and tossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider the situation was full of peril every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns again and goaded it to fresh madness it was all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals unaccustomed to sudden emergencies her head began to swim and her grip upon the bridle to relax choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures she might have abandoned her efforts in despair but for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance at the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb and forcing a way through the drove soon brought her to the outskirts  you re not hurt i hope miss  said her preserver respectfully she looked up at his dark fierce face and laughed saucily  i m awful frightened  she said naively  whoever would have thought that poncho would have been so scared by a lot of cows?   thank god you kept your seat  the other said earnestly he was a tall savagelooking young fellow mounted on a powerful roan horse and clad in the rough dress of a hunter with a long rifle slung over his shoulders  i guess you are the daughter of john ferrier  he remarked  i saw you ride down from his house when you see him ask him if he remembers the jefferson hopes of st louis if he s the same ferrier my father and he were pretty thick   hadn t you better come and ask yourself?  she asked demurely the young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure  i ll do so  he said  we ve been in the mountains for two months and are not over and above in visiting condition he must take us as he finds us   he has a good deal to thank you for and so have i  she answered  he s awful fond of me if those cows had jumped on me he d have never got over it   neither would i  said her companion  you! well i don t see that it would make much matter to you anyhow you ain t even a friend of ours  the young hunter s dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that lucy ferrier laughed aloud  there i didn t mean that  she said  of course you are a friend now you must come and see us now i must push along or father won t trust me with his business any more goodbye!   goodbye  he answered raising his broad sombrero and bending over her little hand she wheeled her mustang round gave it a cut with her ridingwhip and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of dust young jefferson hope rode on with his companions gloomy and taciturn he and they had been among the nevada mountains prospecting for silver and were returning to salt lake city in the hope of raising capital enough to work some lodes which they had discovered he had been as keen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn his thoughts into another channel the sight of the fair young girl as frank and wholesome as the sierra breezes had stirred his volcanic untamed heart to its very depths when she had vanished from his sight he realized that a crisis had come in his life and that neither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to him as this new and allabsorbing one the love which had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden changeable fancy of a boy but rather the wild fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper he had been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook he swore in his heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human perseverance could render him successful he called on john ferrier that night and many times again until his face was a familiar one at the farmhouse john cooped up in the valley and absorbed in his work had had little chance of learning the news of the outside world during the last twelve years all this jefferson hope was able to tell him and in a style which interested lucy as well as her father he had been a pioneer in california and could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in those wild halcyon days he had been a scout too and a trapper a silver explorer and a ranchman wherever stirring adventures were to be had jefferson hope had been there in search of them he soon became a favourite with the old farmer who spoke eloquently of his virtues on such occasions lucy was silent but her blushing cheek and her bright happy eyes showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer her own her honest father may not have observed these symptoms but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her affections it was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled up at the gate she was at the doorway and came down to meet him he threw the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway  i am off lucy  he said taking her two hands in his and gazing tenderly down into her face  i won t ask you to come with me now but will you be ready to come when i am here again?   and when will that be?  she asked blushing and laughing  a couple of months at the outside i will come and claim you then my darling there s no one who can stand between us   and how about father?  she asked  he has given his consent provided we get these mines working all right i have no fear on that head   oh well of course if you and father have arranged it all there s no more to be said  she whispered with her cheek against his broad breast  thank god!  he said hoarsely stooping and kissing her  it is settled then the longer i stay the harder it will be to go they are waiting for me at the ca on goodbye my own darling goodbye in two months you shall see me  he tore himself from her as he spoke and flinging himself upon his horse galloped furiously away never even looking round as though afraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what he was leaving she stood at the gate gazing after him until he vanished from her sight then she walked back into the house the happiest girl in all utah chapter iii john ferrier talks with the prophet three weeks had passed since jefferson hope and his comrades had departed from salt lake city john ferrier s heart was sore within him when he thought of the young man s return and of the impending loss of his adopted child yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the arrangement more than any argument could have done he had always determined deep down in his resolute heart that nothing would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a mormon such a marriage he regarded as no marriage at all but as a shame and a disgrace whatever he might think of the mormon doctrines upon that one point he was inflexible he had to seal his mouth on the subject however for to express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in the land of the saints yes a dangerous matter so dangerous that even the most saintly dared only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath lest something which fell from their lips might be misconstrued and bring down a swift retribution upon them the victims of persecution had now turned persecutors on their own account and persecutors of the most terrible description not the inquisition of seville nor the german vehmgericht nor the secret societies of italy were ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over the state of utah its invisibility and the mystery which was attached to it made this organization doubly terrible it appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent and yet was neither seen nor heard the man who held out against the church vanished away and none knew whither he had gone or what had befallen him his wife and his children awaited him at home but no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands of his secret judges a rash word or a hasty act was followed by annihilation and yet none knew what the nature might be of this terrible power which was suspended over them no wonder that men went about in fear and trembling and that even in the heart of the wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them at first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the recalcitrants who having embraced the mormon faith wished afterwards to pervert or to abandon it soon however it took a wider range the supply of adult women was running short and polygamy without a female population on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed strange rumours began to be bandied about rumours of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where indians had never been seen fresh women appeared in the harems of the elders women who pined and wept and bore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror belated wanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men masked stealthy and noiseless who flitted by them in the darkness these tales and rumours took substance and shape and were corroborated and recorroborated until they resolved themselves into a definite name to this day in the lonely ranches of the west the name of the danite band or the avenging angels is a sinister and an illomened one fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible results served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it inspired in the minds of men none knew who belonged to this ruthless society the names of the participators in the deeds of blood and violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret the very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the prophet and his mission might be one of those who would come forth at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation hence every man feared his neighbour and none spoke of the things which were nearest his heart one fine morning john ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields when he heard the click of the latch and looking through the window saw a stout sandyhaired middleaged man coming up the pathway his heart leapt to his mouth for this was none other than the great brigham young himself full of trepidation for he knew that such a visit boded him little good ferrier ran to the door to greet the mormon chief the latter however received his salutations coldly and followed him with a stern face into the sittingroom  brother ferrier  he said taking a seat and eyeing the farmer keenly from under his lightcoloured eyelashes  the true believers have been good friends to you we picked you up when you were starving in the desert we shared our food with you led you safe to the chosen valley gave you a goodly share of land and allowed you to wax rich under our protection is not this so?   it is so  answered john ferrier  in return for all this we asked but one condition that was that you should embrace the true faith and conform in every way to its usages this you promised to do and this if common report says truly you have neglected   and how have i neglected it?  asked ferrier throwing out his hands in expostulation  have i not given to the common fund? have i not attended at the temple? have i not ?   where are your wives?  asked young looking round him  call them in that i may greet them   it is true that i have not married  ferrier answered  but women were few and there were many who had better claims than i i was not a lonely man i had my daughter to attend to my wants   it is of that daughter that i would speak to you  said the leader of the mormons  she has grown to be the flower of utah and has found favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land  john ferrier groaned internally  there are stories of her which i would fain disbelieve stories that she is sealed to some gentile this must be the gossip of idle tongues what is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted joseph smith?  let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect for if she wed a gentile she commits a grievous sin  this being so it is impossible that you who profess the holy creed should suffer your daughter to violate it  john ferrier made no answer but he played nervously with his ridingwhip  upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested so it has been decided in the sacred council of four the girl is young and we would not have her wed grey hairs neither would we deprive her of all choice we elders have many heifers1 but our children must also be provided stangerson has a son and drebber has a son and either of them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house let her choose between them they are young and rich and of the true faith what say you to that?  1 heber c kemball in one of his sermons alludes to his hundred wives under this endearing epithet ferrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted  you will give us time  he said at last  my daughter is very young she is scarce of an age to marry   she shall have a month to choose  said young rising from his seat  at the end of that time she shall give her answer  he was passing through the door when he turned with flushed face and flashing eyes  it were better for you john ferrier  he thundered  that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the sierra blanco than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of the holy four!  with a threatening gesture of his hand he turned from the door and ferrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path he was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees considering how he should broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon his and looking up he saw her standing beside him one glance at her pale frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed  i could not help it  she said in answer to his look  his voice rang through the house oh father father what shall we do?   don t you scare yourself  he answered drawing her to him and passing his broad rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair  we ll fix it up somehow or another you don t find your fancy kind o  lessening for this chap do you?  a sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer  no of course not i shouldn t care to hear you say you did he s a likely lad and he s a christian which is more than these folk here in spite o  all their praying and preaching there s a party starting for nevada tomorrow and i ll manage to send him a message letting him know the hole we are in if i know anything o  that young man he ll be back here with a speed that would whip electrotelegraphs  lucy laughed through her tears at her father s description  when he comes he will advise us for the best but it is for you that i am frightened dear one hears one hears such dreadful stories about those who oppose the prophet something terrible always happens to them   but we haven t opposed him yet  her father answered  it will be time to look out for squalls when we do we have a clear month before us at the end of that i guess we had best shin out of utah   leave utah!   that s about the size of it   but the farm?   we will raise as much as we can in money and let the rest go to tell the truth lucy it isn t the first time i have thought of doing it i don t care about knuckling under to any man as these folk do to their darned prophet i m a freeborn american and it s all new to me guess i m too old to learn if he comes browsing about this farm he might chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite direction   but they won t let us leave  his daughter objected  wait till jefferson comes and we ll soon manage that in the meantime don t you fret yourself my dearie and don t get your eyes swelled up else he ll be walking into me when he sees you there s nothing to be afeared about and there s no danger at all  john ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone but she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the fastening of the doors that night and that he carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom chapter iv a flight for life on the morning which followed his interview with the mormon prophet john ferrier went in to salt lake city and having found his acquaintance who was bound for the nevada mountains he entrusted him with his message to jefferson hope in it he told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened them and how necessary it was that he should return having done thus he felt easier in his mind and returned home with a lighter heart as he approached his farm he was surprised to see a horse hitched to each of the posts of the gate still more surprised was he on entering to find two young men in possession of his sittingroom one with a long pale face was leaning back in the rockingchair with his feet cocked up upon the stove the other a bullnecked youth with coarse bloated features was standing in front of the window with his hands in his pocket whistling a popular hymn both of them nodded to ferrier as he entered and the one in the rockingchair commenced the conversation  maybe you don t know us  he said  this here is the son of elder drebber and i m joseph stangerson who travelled with you in the desert when the lord stretched out his hand and gathered you into the true fold   as he will all the nations in his own good time  said the other in a nasal voice  he grindeth slowly but exceeding small  john ferrier bowed coldly he had guessed who his visitors were  we have come  continued stangerson  at the advice of our fathers to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her as i have but four wives and brother drebber here has seven it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one   nay nay brother stangerson  cried the other  the question is not how many wives we have but how many we can keep my father has now given over his mills to me and i am the richer man   but my prospects are better  said the other warmly  when the lord removes my father i shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory then i am your elder and am higher in the church   it will be for the maiden to decide  rejoined young drebber smirking at his own reflection in the glass  we will leave it all to her decision  during this dialogue john ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway hardly able to keep his ridingwhip from the backs of his two visitors  look here  he said at last striding up to them  when my daughter summons you you can come but until then i don t want to see your faces again  the two young mormons stared at him in amazement in their eyes this competition between them for the maiden s hand was the highest of honours both to her and her father  there are two ways out of the room  cried ferrier  there is the door and there is the window which do you care to use?  his brown face looked so savage and his gaunt hands so threatening that his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat the old farmer followed them to the door  let me know when you have settled which it is to be  he said sardonically  you shall smart for this!  stangerson cried white with rage  you have defied the prophet and the council of four you shall rue it to the end of your days   the hand of the lord shall be heavy upon you  cried young drebber  he will arise and smite you!   then i ll start the smiting  exclaimed ferrier furiously and would have rushed upstairs for his gun had not lucy seized him by the arm and restrained him before he could escape from her the clatter of horses  hoofs told him that they were beyond his reach  the young canting rascals!  he exclaimed wiping the perspiration from his forehead  i would sooner see you in your grave my girl than the wife of either of them   and so should i father  she answered with spirit  but jefferson will soon be here   yes it will not be long before he comes the sooner the better for we do not know what their next move may be  it was indeed high time that someone capable of giving advice and help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted daughter in the whole history of the settlement there had never been such a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the elders if minor errors were punished so sternly what would be the fate of this arch rebel ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no avail to him others as well known and as rich as himself had been spirited away before now and their goods given over to the church he was a brave man but he trembled at the vague shadowy terrors which hung over him any known danger he could face with a firm lip but this suspense was unnerving he concealed his fears from his daughter however and affected to make light of the whole matter though she with the keen eye of love saw plainly that he was ill at ease he expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from young as to his conduct and he was not mistaken though it came in an unlookedfor manner upon rising next morning he found to his surprise a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest on it was printed in bold straggling letters   twentynine days are given you for amendment and then  the dash was more fearinspiring than any threat could have been how this warning came into his room puzzled john ferrier sorely for his servants slept in an outhouse and the doors and windows had all been secured he crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter but the incident struck a chill into his heart the twentynine days were evidently the balance of the month which young had promised what strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such mysterious powers? the hand which fastened that pin might have struck him to the heart and he could never have known who had slain him still more shaken was he next morning they had sat down to their breakfast when lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards in the centre of the ceiling was scrawled with a burned stick apparently the number 28 to his daughter it was unintelligible and he did not enlighten her that night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward he saw and he heard nothing and yet in the morning a great 27 had been painted upon the outside of his door thus day followed day and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls sometimes upon the floors occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings with all his vigilance john ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded a horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them he became haggard and restless and his eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature he had but one hope in life now and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from nevada twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten but there was no news of the absentee one by one the numbers dwindled down and still there came no sign of him whenever a horseman clattered down the road or a driver shouted at his team the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking that help had arrived at last at last when he saw five give way to four and that again to three he lost heart and abandoned all hope of escape singlehanded and with his limited knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement he knew that he was powerless the morefrequented roads were strictly watched and guarded and none could pass along them without an order from the council turn which way he would there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter s dishonour he was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles and searching vainly for some way out of them that morning had shown the figure 2 upon the wall of his house and the next day would be the last of the allotted time what was to happen then? all manner of vague and terrible fancies filled his imagination and his daughter what was to become of her after he was gone? was there no escape from the invisible network which was drawn all round them he sank his head upon the table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence what was that? in the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound low but very distinct in the quiet of the night it came from the door of the house ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently there was a pause for a few moments and then the low insidious sound was repeated someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived john ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open outside all was calm and quiet the night was fine and the stars were twinkling brightly overhead the little front garden lay before the farmer s eyes bounded by the fence and gate but neither there nor on the road was any human being to be seen with a sigh of relief ferrier looked to right and to left until happening to glance straight down at his own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face upon the ground with arms and legs all asprawl so unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out his first thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying man but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent once within the house the man sprang to his feet closed the door and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of jefferson hope  good god!  gasped john ferrier  how you scared me! whatever made you come in like that   give me food  the other said hoarsely  i have had no time for bite or sup for eightandforty hours  he flung himself upon the cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host s supper and devoured it voraciously  does lucy bear up well?  he asked when he had satisfied his hunger  yes she does not know the danger  her father answered  that is well the house is watched on every side that is why i crawled my way up to it they may be darned sharp but they re not quite sharp enough to catch a washoe hunter  john ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a devoted ally he seized the young man s leathery hand and wrung it cordially  you re a man to be proud of  he said  there are not many who would come to share our danger and our troubles   you ve hit it there pard  the young hunter answered  i have a respect for you but if you were alone in this business i d think twice before i put my head into such a hornet s nest it s lucy that brings me here and before harm comes on her i guess there will be one less o  the hope family in utah   what are we to do?   tomorrow is your last day and unless you act tonight you are lost i have a mule and two horses waiting in the eagle ravine how much money have you?   two thousand dollars in gold and five in notes   that will do i have as much more to add to it we must push for carson city through the mountains you had best wake lucy it is as well that the servants do not sleep in the house  while ferrier was absent preparing his daughter for the approaching journey jefferson hope packed all the eatables that he could find into a small parcel and filled a stoneware jar with water for he knew by experience that the mountain wells were few and far between he had hardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his daughter all dressed and ready for a start the greeting between the lovers was warm but brief for minutes were precious and there was much to be done  we must make our start at once  said jefferson hope speaking in a low but resolute voice like one who realizes the greatness of the peril but has steeled his heart to meet it  the front and back entrances are watched but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the fields once on the road we are only two miles from the ravine where the horses are waiting by daybreak we should be halfway through the mountains   what if we are stopped  asked ferrier hope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his tunic  if they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them with us  he said with a sinister smile the lights inside the house had all been extinguished and from the darkened window ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own and which he was now about to abandon for ever he had long nerved himself to the sacrifice however and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes all looked so peaceful and happy the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grainland that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes jefferson hope had the scanty provisions and water while lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions opening the window very slowly and carefully they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night and then one by one passed through into the little garden with bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it and gained the shelter of the hedge which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields they had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow where they lay silent and trembling it was as well that his prairie training had given jefferson hope the ears of a lynx he and his friends had hardly crouched down before the melancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of them which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small distance at the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had been making and uttered the plaintive signal cry again on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity  tomorrow at midnight  said the first who appeared to be in authority  when the whippoorwill calls three times   it is well  returned the other  shall i tell brother drebber?   pass it on to him and from him to the others nine to seven!   seven to five!  repeated the other and the two figures flitted away in different directions their concluding words had evidently been some form of sign and countersign the instant that their footsteps had died away in the distance jefferson hope sprang to his feet and helping his companions through the gap led the way across the fields at the top of his speed supporting and halfcarrying the girl when her strength appeared to fail her  hurry on! hurry on!  he gasped from time to time  we are through the line of sentinels everything depends on speed hurry on!  once on the high road they made rapid progress only once did they meet anyone and then they managed to slip into a field and so avoid recognition before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains two dark jagged peaks loomed above them through the darkness and the defile which led between them was the eagle ca on in which the horses were awaiting them with unerring instinct jefferson hope picked his way among the great boulders and along the bed of a driedup watercourse until he came to the retired corner screened with rocks where the faithful animals had been picketed the girl was placed upon the mule and old ferrier upon one of the horses with his moneybag while jefferson hope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path it was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face nature in her wildest moods on the one side a great crag towered up a thousand feet or more black stern and menacing with long basaltic columns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster on the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance impossible between the two ran the irregular track so narrow in places that they had to travel in indian file and so rough that only practised riders could have traversed it at all yet in spite of all dangers and difficulties the hearts of the fugitives were light within them for every step increased the distance between them and the terrible despotism from which they were flying they soon had a proof however that they were still within the jurisdiction of the saints they had reached the very wildest and most desolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry and pointed upwards on a rock which overlooked the track showing out dark and plain against the sky there stood a solitary sentinel he saw them as soon as they perceived him and his military challenge of  who goes there?  rang through the silent ravine  travellers for nevada  said jefferson hope with his hand upon the rifle which hung by his saddle they could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun and peering down at them as if dissatisfied at their reply  by whose permission?  he asked  the holy four  answered ferrier his mormon experiences had taught him that that was the highest authority to which he could refer  nine from seven  cried the sentinel  seven from five  returned jefferson hope promptly remembering the countersign which he had heard in the garden  pass and the lord go with you  said the voice from above beyond his post the path broadened out and the horses were able to break into a trot looking back they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon his gun and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen people and that freedom lay before them chapter v the avenging angels all night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular and rockstrewn paths more than once they lost their way but hope s intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once more when morning broke a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them in every direction the great snowcapped peaks hemmed them in peeping over each other s shoulders to the far horizon so steep were the rocky banks on either side of them that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them nor was the fear entirely an illusion for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner even as they passed a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges and startled the weary horses into a gallop as the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon the caps of the great mountains lit up one after the other like lamps at a festival until they were all ruddy and glowing the magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy at a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses while they partook of a hasty breakfast lucy and her father would fain have rested longer but jefferson hope was inexorable  they will be upon our track by this time  he said  everything depends upon our speed once safe in carson we may rest for the remainder of our lives  during the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their enemies at nighttime they chose the base of a beetling crag where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind and there huddled together for warmth they enjoyed a few hours  sleep before daybreak however they were up and on their way once more they had seen no signs of any pursuers and jefferson hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had incurred he little knew how far that iron grasp could reach or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them about the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provisions began to run out this gave the hunter little uneasiness however for there was game to be had among the mountains and he had frequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life choosing a sheltered nook he piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire at which his companions might warm themselves for they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level and the air was bitter and keen having tethered the horses and bade lucy adieu he threw his gun over his shoulder and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way looking back he saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire while the three animals stood motionless in the background then the intervening rocks hid them from his view he walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success though from the marks upon the bark of the trees and other indications he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity at last after two or three hours  fruitless search he was thinking of turning back in despair when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart on the edge of a jutting pinnacle three or four hundred feet above him there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance but armed with a pair of gigantic horns the bighorn for so it is called was acting probably as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction and had not perceived him lying on his face he rested his rifle upon a rock and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger the animal sprang into the air tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice and then came crashing down into the valley beneath the creature was too unwieldy to lift so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank with this trophy over his shoulder he hastened to retrace his steps for the evening was already drawing in he had hardly started however before he realized the difficulty which faced him in his eagerness he had wandered far past the ravines which were known to him and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken the valley in which he found himself divided and subdivided into many gorges which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other he followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before convinced that he had taken the wrong turn he tried another but with the same result night was coming on rapidly and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track for the moon had not yet risen and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound weighed down with his burden and weary from his exertions he stumbled along keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to lucy and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey he had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it they must he reflected be awaiting him anxiously for he had been absent nearly five hours in the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen reecho to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming he paused and listened for an answer none came save his own cry which clattered up the dreary silent ravines and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions again he shouted even louder than before and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago a vague nameless dread came over him and he hurried onwards frantically dropping the precious food in his agitation when he turned the corner he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had been lit there was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there but it had evidently not been tended since his departure the same dead silence still reigned all round with his fears all changed to convictions he hurried on there was no living creature near the remains of the fire animals man maiden all were gone it was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence a disaster which had embraced them all and yet had left no traces behind it bewildered and stunned by this blow jefferson hope felt his head spin round and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling he was essentially a man of action however and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence seizing a halfconsumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire he blew it into a flame and proceeded with its help to examine the little camp the ground was all stamped down by the feet of horses showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitives and the direction of their tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to salt lake city had they carried back both of his companions with them? jefferson hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within him a little way on one side of the camp was a lowlying heap of reddish soil which had assuredly not been there before there was no mistaking it for anything but a newlydug grave as the young hunter approached it he perceived that a stick had been planted on it with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it the inscription upon the paper was brief but to the point john ferrier formerly of salt lake city died august 4th 1860 the sturdy old man whom he had left so short a time before was gone then and this was all his epitaph jefferson hope looked wildly round to see if there was a second grave but there was no sign of one lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny by becoming one of the harem of the elder s son as the young fellow realized the certainty of her fate and his own powerlessness to prevent it he wished that he too was lying with the old farmer in his last silent restingplace again however his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs from despair if there was nothing else left to him he could at least devote his life to revenge with indomitable patience and perseverance jefferson hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness which he may have learned from the indians amongst whom he had lived as he stood by the desolate fire he felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution brought by his own hand upon his enemies his strong will and untiring energy should he determined be devoted to that one end with a grim white face he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food and having stirred up the smouldering fire he cooked enough to last him for a few days this he made up into a bundle and tired as he was he set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the avenging angels for five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback at night he flung himself down among the rocks and snatched a few hours of sleep but before daybreak he was always well on his way on the sixth day he reached the eagle ca on from which they had commenced their illfated flight thence he could look down upon the home of the saints worn and exhausted he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him as he looked at it he observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets and other signs of festivity he was still speculating as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse s hoofs and saw a mounted man riding towards him as he approached he recognized him as a mormon named cowper to whom he had rendered services at different times he therefore accosted him when he got up to him with the object of finding out what lucy ferrier s fate had been  i am jefferson hope  he said  you remember me  the mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment indeed it was difficult to recognize in this tattered unkempt wanderer with ghastly white face and fierce wild eyes the spruce young hunter of former days having however at last satisfied himself as to his identity the man s surprise changed to consternation  you are mad to come here  he cried  it is as much as my own life is worth to be seen talking with you there is a warrant against you from the holy four for assisting the ferriers away   i don t fear them or their warrant  hope said earnestly  you must know something of this matter cowper i conjure you by everything you hold dear to answer a few questions we have always been friends for god s sake don t refuse to answer me   what is it?  the mormon asked uneasily  be quick the very rocks have ears and the trees eyes   what has become of lucy ferrier?   she was married yesterday to young drebber hold up man hold up you have no life left in you   don t mind me  said hope faintly he was white to the very lips and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning  married you say?   married yesterday that s what those flags are for on the endowment house there was some words between young drebber and young stangerson as to which was to have her they d both been in the party that followed them and stangerson had shot her father which seemed to give him the best claim but when they argued it out in council drebber s party was the stronger so the prophet gave her over to him no one won t have her very long though for i saw death in her face yesterday she is more like a ghost than a woman are you off then?   yes i am off  said jefferson hope who had risen from his seat his face might have been chiselled out of marble so hard and set was its expression while its eyes glowed with a baleful light  where are you going?   never mind  he answered and slinging his weapon over his shoulder strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to the haunts of the wild beasts amongst them all there was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself the prediction of the mormon was only too well fulfilled whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced poor lucy never held up her head again but pined away and died within a month her sottish husband who had married her principally for the sake of john ferrier s property did not affect any great grief at his bereavement but his other wives mourned over her and sat up with her the night before the burial as is the mormon custom they were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning when to their inexpressible fear and astonishment the door was flung open and a savagelooking weatherbeaten man in tattered garments strode into the room without a glance or a word to the cowering women he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of lucy ferrier stooping over her he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead and then snatching up her hand he took the weddingring from her finger  she shall not be buried in that  he cried with a fierce snarl and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone so strange and so brief was the episode that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared for some months jefferson hope lingered among the mountains leading a strange wild life and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which possessed him tales were told in the city of the weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges once a bullet whistled through stangerson s window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him on another occasion as drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder crashed down on him and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon his face the two young mormons were not long in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives and led repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy but always without success then they adopted the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall and of having their houses guarded after a time they were able to relax these measures for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness far from doing so it had if anything augmented it the hunter s mind was of a hard unyielding nature and the predominant idea of revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any other emotion he was however above all things practical he soon realized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it exposure and want of wholesome food were wearing him out if he died like a dog among the mountains what was to become of his revenge then? and yet such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted he felt that that was to play his enemy s game so he reluctantly returned to the old nevada mines there to recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation his intention had been to be absent a year at the most but a combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly five at the end of that time however his memory of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that memorable night when he had stood by john ferrier s grave disguised and under an assumed name he returned to salt lake city careless what became of his own life as long as he obtained what he knew to be justice there he found evil tidings awaiting him there had been a schism among the chosen people a few months before some of the younger members of the church having rebelled against the authority of the elders and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the malcontents who had left utah and become gentiles among these had been drebber and stangerson and no one knew whither they had gone rumour reported that drebber had managed to convert a large part of his property into money and that he had departed a wealthy man while his companion stangerson was comparatively poor there was no clue at all however as to their whereabouts many a man however vindictive would have abandoned all thought of revenge in the face of such a difficulty but jefferson hope never faltered for a moment with the small competence he possessed eked out by such employment as he could pick up he travelled from town to town through the united states in quest of his enemies year passed into year his black hair turned grizzled but still he wandered on a human bloodhound with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he had devoted his life at last his perseverance was rewarded it was but a glance of a face in a window but that one glance told him that cleveland in ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of he returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged it chanced however that drebber looking from his window had recognized the vagrant in the street and had read murder in his eyes he hurried before a justice of the peace accompanied by stangerson who had become his private secretary and represented to him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of an old rival that evening jefferson hope was taken into custody and not being able to find sureties was detained for some weeks when at last he was liberated it was only to find that drebber s house was deserted and that he and his secretary had departed for europe again the avenger had been foiled and again his concentrated hatred urged him to continue the pursuit funds were wanting however and for some time he had to return to work saving every dollar for his approaching journey at last having collected enough to keep life in him he departed for europe and tracked his enemies from city to city working his way in any menial capacity but never overtaking the fugitives when he reached st petersburg they had departed for paris and when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off for copenhagen at the danish capital he was again a few days late for they had journeyed on to london where he at last succeeded in running them to earth as to what occurred there we cannot do better than quote the old hunter s own account as duly recorded in dr watson s journal to which we are already under such obligations chapter vi a continuation of the reminiscences of john watson md our prisoner s furious resistance did not apparently indicate any ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves for on finding himself powerless he smiled in an affable manner and expressed his hopes that he had not hurt any of us in the scuffle  i guess you re going to take me to the policestation  he remarked to sherlock holmes  my cab s at the door if you ll loose my legs i ll walk down to it i m not so light to lift as i used to be  gregson and lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this proposition rather a bold one but holmes at once took the prisoner at his word and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ankles he rose and stretched his legs as though to assure himself that they were free once more i remember that i thought to myself as i eyed him that i had seldom seen a more powerfully built man and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was as formidable as his personal strength  if there s a vacant place for a chief of the police i reckon you are the man for it  he said gazing with undisguised admiration at my fellowlodger  the way you kept on my trail was a caution   you had better come with me  said holmes to the two detectives  i can drive you  said lestrade  good! and gregson can come inside with me you too doctor you have taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us  i assented gladly and we all descended together our prisoner made no attempt at escape but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his and we followed him lestrade mounted the box whipped up the horse and brought us in a very short time to our destination we were ushered into a small chamber where a police inspector noted down our prisoner s name and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged the official was a whitefaced unemotional man who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way  the prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week  he said  in the mean time mr jefferson hope have you anything that you wish to say? i must warn you that your words will be taken down and may be used against you   i ve got a good deal to say  our prisoner said slowly  i want to tell you gentlemen all about it   hadn t you better reserve that for your trial?  asked the inspector  i may never be tried  he answered  you needn t look startled it isn t suicide i am thinking of are you a doctor?  he turned his fierce dark eyes upon me as he asked this last question  yes i am  i answered  then put your hand here  he said with a smile motioning with his manacled wrists towards his chest i did so and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and commotion which was going on inside the walls of his chest seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful engine was at work in the silence of the room i could hear a dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source  why  i cried  you have an aortic aneurism!   that s what they call it  he said placidly  i went to a doctor last week about it and he told me that it is bound to burst before many days passed it has been getting worse for years i got it from overexposure and underfeeding among the salt lake mountains i ve done my work now and i don t care how soon i go but i should like to leave some account of the business behind me i don t want to be remembered as a common cutthroat  the inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the advisability of allowing him to tell his story  do you consider doctor that there is immediate danger?  the former asked  most certainly there is  i answered  in that case it is clearly our duty in the interests of justice to take his statement  said the inspector  you are at liberty sir to give your account which i again warn you will be taken down   i ll sit down with your leave  the prisoner said suiting the action to the word  this aneurism of mine makes me easily tired and the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters i m on the brink of the grave and i am not likely to lie to you every word i say is the absolute truth and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to me  with these words jefferson hope leaned back in his chair and began the following remarkable statement he spoke in a calm and methodical manner as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough i can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account for i have had access to lestrade s notebook in which the prisoner s words were taken down exactly as they were uttered  it don t much matter to you why i hated these men  he said  it s enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings a father and a daughter and that they had therefore forfeited their own lives after the lapse of time that has passed since their crime it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court i knew of their guilt though and i determined that i should be judge jury and executioner all rolled into one you d have done the same if you have any manhood in you if you had been in my place  that girl that i spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago she was forced into marrying that same drebber and broke her heart over it i took the marriage ring from her dead finger and i vowed that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring and that his last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished i have carried it about with me and have followed him and his accomplice over two continents until i caught them they thought to tire me out but they could not do it if i die tomorrow as is likely enough i die knowing that my work in this world is done and well done they have perished and by my hand there is nothing left for me to hope for or to desire  they were rich and i was poor so that it was no easy matter for me to follow them when i got to london my pocket was about empty and i found that i must turn my hand to something for my living driving and riding are as natural to me as walking so i applied at a cabowner s office and soon got employment i was to bring a certain sum a week to the owner and whatever was over that i might keep for myself there was seldom much over but i managed to scrape along somehow the hardest job was to learn my way about for i reckon that of all the mazes that ever were contrived this city is the most confusing i had a map beside me though and when once i had spotted the principal hotels and stations i got on pretty well  it was some time before i found out where my two gentlemen were living but i inquired and inquired until at last i dropped across them they were at a boardinghouse at camberwell over on the other side of the river when once i found them out i knew that i had them at my mercy i had grown my beard and there was no chance of their recognizing me i would dog them and follow them until i saw my opportunity i was determined that they should not escape me again  they were very near doing it for all that go where they would about london i was always at their heels sometimes i followed them on my cab and sometimes on foot but the former was the best for then they could not get away from me it was only early in the morning or late at night that i could earn anything so that i began to get behind hand with my employer i did not mind that however as long as i could lay my hand upon the men i wanted  they were very cunning though they must have thought that there was some chance of their being followed for they would never go out alone and never after nightfall during two weeks i drove behind them every day and never once saw them separate drebber himself was drunk half the time but stangerson was not to be caught napping i watched them late and early but never saw the ghost of a chance but i was not discouraged for something told me that the hour had almost come my only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work undone  at last one evening i was driving up and down torquay terrace as the street was called in which they boarded when i saw a cab drive up to their door presently some luggage was brought out and after a time drebber and stangerson followed it and drove off i whipped up my horse and kept within sight of them feeling very ill at ease for i feared that they were going to shift their quarters at euston station they got out and i left a boy to hold my horse and followed them on to the platform i heard them ask for the liverpool train and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours stangerson seemed to be put out at that but drebber was rather pleased than otherwise i got so close to them in the bustle that i could hear every word that passed between them drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him his companion remonstrated with him and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together drebber answered that the matter was a delicate one and that he must go alone i could not catch what stangerson said to that but the other burst out swearing and reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant and that he must not presume to dictate to him on that the secretary gave it up as a bad job and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at halliday s private hotel to which drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven and made his way out of the station  the moment for which i had waited so long had at last come i had my enemies within my power together they could protect each other but singly they were at my mercy i did not act however with undue precipitation my plans were already formed there is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him and why retribution has come upon him i had my plans arranged by which i should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out it chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the brixton road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage it was claimed that same evening and returned but in the interval i had taken a moulding of it and had a duplicate constructed by means of this i had access to at least one spot in this great city where i could rely upon being free from interruption how to get drebber to that house was the difficult problem which i had now to solve  he walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops staying for nearly halfanhour in the last of them when he came out he staggered in his walk and was evidently pretty well on there was a hansom just in front of me and he hailed it i followed it so close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way we rattled across waterloo bridge and through miles of streets until to my astonishment we found ourselves back in the terrace in which he had boarded i could not imagine what his intention was in returning there but i went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from the house he entered it and his hansom drove away give me a glass of water if you please my mouth gets dry with the talking  i handed him the glass and he drank it down  that s better  he said  well i waited for a quarter of an hour or more when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the house next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared one of whom was drebber and the other was a young chap whom i had never seen before this fellow had drebber by the collar and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half across the road  you hound  he cried shaking his stick at him  i ll teach you to insult an honest girl!  he was so hot that i think he would have thrashed drebber with his cudgel only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him he ran as far as the corner and then seeing my cab he hailed me and jumped in  drive me to halliday s private hotel  said he  when i had him fairly inside my cab my heart jumped so with joy that i feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong i drove along slowly weighing in my own mind what it was best to do i might take him right out into the country and there in some deserted lane have my last interview with him i had almost decided upon this when he solved the problem for me the craze for drink had seized him again and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace he went in leaving word that i should wait for him there he remained until closing time and when he came out he was so far gone that i knew the game was in my own hands  don t imagine that i intended to kill him in cold blood it would only have been rigid justice if i had done so but i could not bring myself to do it i had long determined that he should have a show for his life if he chose to take advantage of it among the many billets which i have filled in america during my wandering life i was once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at york college one day the professor was lecturing on poisons and he showed his students some alkaloid as he called it which he had extracted from some south american arrow poison and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant death i spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept and when they were all gone i helped myself to a little of it i was a fairly good dispenser so i worked this alkaloid into small soluble pills and each pill i put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison i determined at the time that when i had my chance my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes while i ate the pill that remained it would be quite as deadly and a good deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief from that day i had always my pill boxes about with me and the time had now come when i was to use them  it was nearer one than twelve and a wild bleak night blowing hard and raining in torrents dismal as it was outside i was glad within so glad that i could have shouted out from pure exultation if any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing and longed for it during twenty long years and then suddenly found it within your reach you would understand my feelings i lit a cigar and puffed at it to steady my nerves but my hands were trembling and my temples throbbing with excitement as i drove i could see old john ferrier and sweet lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me just as plain as i see you all in this room all the way they were ahead of me one on each side of the horse until i pulled up at the house in the brixton road  there was not a soul to be seen nor a sound to be heard except the dripping of the rain when i looked in at the window i found drebber all huddled together in a drunken sleep i shook him by the arm  it s time to get out  i said  all right cabby  said he  i suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned for he got out without another word and followed me down the garden i had to walk beside him to keep him steady for he was still a little topheavy when we came to the door i opened it and led him into the front room i give you my word that all the way the father and the daughter were walking in front of us  it s infernally dark  said he stamping about  we ll soon have a light  i said striking a match and putting it to a wax candle which i had brought with me  now enoch drebber  i continued turning to him and holding the light to my own face  who am i?   he gazed at me with bleared drunken eyes for a moment and then i saw a horror spring up in them and convulse his whole features which showed me that he knew me he staggered back with a livid face and i saw the perspiration break out upon his brow while his teeth chattered in his head at the sight i leaned my back against the door and laughed loud and long i had always known that vengeance would be sweet but i had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me  you dog!  i said  i have hunted you from salt lake city to st petersburg and you have always escaped me now at last your wanderings have come to an end for either you or i shall never see tomorrow s sun rise  he shrunk still further away as i spoke and i could see on his face that he thought i was mad so i was for the time the pulses in my temples beat like sledgehammers and i believe i would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me  what do you think of lucy ferrier now?  i cried locking the door and shaking the key in his face  punishment has been slow in coming but it has overtaken you at last  i saw his coward lips tremble as i spoke he would have begged for his life but he knew well that it was useless  would you murder me?  he stammered  there is no murder  i answered  who talks of murdering a mad dog? what mercy had you upon my poor darling when you dragged her from her slaughtered father and bore her away to your accursed and shameless harem   it was not i who killed her father  he cried  but it was you who broke her innocent heart  i shrieked thrusting the box before him  let the high god judge between us choose and eat there is death in one and life in the other i shall take what you leave let us see if there is justice upon the earth or if we are ruled by chance   he cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy but i drew my knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me then i swallowed the other and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or more waiting to see which was to live and which was to die shall i ever forget the look which came over his face when the first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system? i laughed as i saw it and held lucy s marriage ring in front of his eyes it was but for a moment for the action of the alkaloid is rapid a spasm of pain contorted his features he threw his hands out in front of him staggered and then with a hoarse cry fell heavily upon the floor i turned him over with my foot and placed my hand upon his heart there was no movement he was dead!  the blood had been streaming from my nose but i had taken no notice of it i don t know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police upon a wrong track for i felt lighthearted and cheerful i remembered a german being found in new york with rache written up above him and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must have done it i guessed that what puzzled the new yorkers would puzzle the londoners so i dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall then i walked down to my cab and found that there was nobody about and that the night was still very wild i had driven some distance when i put my hand into the pocket in which i usually kept lucy s ring and found that it was not there i was thunderstruck at this for it was the only memento that i had of her thinking that i might have dropped it when i stooped over drebber s body i drove back and leaving my cab in a side street i went boldly up to the house for i was ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring when i arrived there i walked right into the arms of a policeofficer who was coming out and only managed to disarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk  that was how enoch drebber came to his end all i had to do then was to do as much for stangerson and so pay off john ferrier s debt i knew that he was staying at halliday s private hotel and i hung about all day but he never came out i fancy that he suspected something when drebber failed to put in an appearance he was cunning was stangerson and always on his guard if he thought he could keep me off by staying indoors he was very much mistaken i soon found out which was the window of his bedroom and early next morning i took advantage of some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel and so made my way into his room in the grey of the dawn i woke him up and told him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so long before i described drebber s death to him and i gave him the same choice of the poisoned pills instead of grasping at the chance of safety which that offered him he sprang from his bed and flew at my throat in selfdefence i stabbed him to the heart it would have been the same in any case for providence would never have allowed his guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison  i have little more to say and it s as well for i am about done up i went on cabbing it for a day or so intending to keep at it until i could save enough to take me back to america i was standing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called jefferson hope and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221b baker street i went round suspecting no harm and the next thing i knew this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists and as neatly shackled as ever i saw in my life that s the whole of my story gentlemen you may consider me to be a murderer but i hold that i am just as much an officer of justice as you are  so thrilling had the man s narrative been and his manner was so impressive that we had sat silent and absorbed even the professional detectives _blas _ as they were in every detail of crime appeared to be keenly interested in the man s story when he finished we sat for some minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of lestrade s pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand account  there is only one point on which i should like a little more information  sherlock holmes said at last  who was your accomplice who came for the ring which i advertised?  the prisoner winked at my friend jocosely  i can tell my own secrets  he said  but i don t get other people into trouble i saw your advertisement and i thought it might be a plant or it might be the ring which i wanted my friend volunteered to go and see i think you ll own he did it smartly   not a doubt of that  said holmes heartily  now gentlemen  the inspector remarked gravely  the forms of the law must be complied with on thursday the prisoner will be brought before the magistrates and your attendance will be required until then i will be responsible for him  he rang the bell as he spoke and jefferson hope was led off by a couple of warders while my friend and i made our way out of the station and took a cab back to baker street chapter vii the conclusion we had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the thursday but when the thursday came there was no occasion for our testimony a higher judge had taken the matter in hand and jefferson hope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would be meted out to him on the very night after his capture the aneurism burst and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the cell with a placid smile upon his face as though he had been able in his dying moments to look back upon a useful life and on work well done  gregson and lestrade will be wild about his death  holmes remarked as we chatted it over next evening  where will their grand advertisement be now?   i don t see that they had very much to do with his capture  i answered  what you do in this world is a matter of no consequence  returned my companion bitterly  the question is what can you make people believe that you have done never mind  he continued more brightly after a pause  i would not have missed the investigation for anything there has been no better case within my recollection simple as it was there were several most instructive points about it   simple!  i ejaculated  well really it can hardly be described as otherwise  said sherlock holmes smiling at my surprise  the proof of its intrinsic simplicity is that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions i was able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days   that is true  said i  i have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide rather than a hindrance in solving a problem of this sort the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards that is a very useful accomplishment and a very easy one but people do not practise it much in the everyday affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards and so the other comes to be neglected there are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically   i confess  said i  that i do not quite follow you   i hardly expected that you would let me see if i can make it clearer most people if you describe a train of events to them will tell you what the result would be they can put those events together in their minds and argue from them that something will come to pass there are few people however who if you told them a result would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result this power is what i mean when i talk of reasoning backwards or analytically   i understand  said i  now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself now let me endeavour to show you the different steps in my reasoning to begin at the beginning i approached the house as you know on foot and with my mind entirely free from all impressions i naturally began by examining the roadway and there as i have already explained to you i saw clearly the marks of a cab which i ascertained by inquiry must have been there during the night i satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels the ordinary london growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman s brougham  this was the first point gained i then walked slowly down the garden path which happened to be composed of a clay soil peculiarly suitable for taking impressions no doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning there is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps happily i have always laid great stress upon it and much practice has made it second nature to me i saw the heavy footmarks of the constables but i saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden it was easy to tell that they had been before the others because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them in this way my second link was formed which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number one remarkable for his height as i calculated from the length of his stride and the other fashionably dressed to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots  on entering the house this last inference was confirmed my wellbooted man lay before me the tall one then had done the murder if murder there was there was no wound upon the dead man s person but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon him men who die from heart disease or any sudden natural cause never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their features having sniffed the dead man s lips i detected a slightly sour smell and i came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him again i argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face by the method of exclusion i had arrived at this result for no other hypothesis would meet the facts do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea the forcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals the cases of dolsky in odessa and of leturier in montpellier will occur at once to any toxicologist  and now came the great question as to the reason why robbery had not been the object of the murder for nothing was taken was it politics then or was it a woman? that was the question which confronted me i was inclined from the first to the latter supposition political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly this murder had on the contrary been done most deliberately and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room showing that he had been there all the time it must have been a private wrong and not a political one which called for such a methodical revenge when the inscription was discovered upon the wall i was more inclined than ever to my opinion the thing was too evidently a blind when the ring was found however it settled the question clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman it was at this point that i asked gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to cleveland as to any particular point in mr drebber s former career he answered you remember in the negative  i then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer s height and furnished me with the additional details as to the trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails i had already come to the conclusion since there were no signs of a struggle that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderer s nose in his excitement i could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet it is seldom that any man unless he is very fullblooded breaks out in this way through emotion so i hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddyfaced man events proved that i had judged correctly  having left the house i proceeded to do what gregson had neglected i telegraphed to the head of the police at cleveland limiting my enquiry to the circumstances connected with the marriage of enoch drebber the answer was conclusive it told me that drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in love named jefferson hope and that this same hope was at present in europe i knew now that i held the clue to the mystery in my hand and all that remained was to secure the murderer  i had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the house with drebber was none other than the man who had driven the cab the marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it where then could the driver be unless he were inside the house? again it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eyes as it were of a third person who was sure to betray him lastly supposing one man wished to dog another through london what better means could he adopt than to turn cabdriver all these considerations led me to the irresistible conclusion that jefferson hope was to be found among the jarveys of the metropolis  if he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to be on the contrary from his point of view any sudden change would be likely to draw attention to himself he would probably for a time at least continue to perform his duties there was no reason to suppose that he was going under an assumed name why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one? i therefore organized my street arab detective corps and sent them systematically to every cab proprietor in london until they ferreted out the man that i wanted how well they succeeded and how quickly i took advantage of it are still fresh in your recollection the murder of stangerson was an incident which was entirely unexpected but which could hardly in any case have been prevented through it as you know i came into possession of the pills the existence of which i had already surmised you see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break or flaw   it is wonderful!  i cried  your merits should be publicly recognized you should publish an account of the case if you won t i will for you   you may do what you like doctor  he answered  see here!  he continued handing a paper over to me  look at this!  it was the _echo_ for the day and the paragraph to which he pointed was devoted to the case in question  the public  it said  have lost a sensational treat through the sudden death of the man hope who was suspected of the murder of mr enoch drebber and of mr joseph stangerson the details of the case will probably be never known now though we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud in which love and mormonism bore a part it seems that both the victims belonged in their younger days to the latter day saints and hope the deceased prisoner hails also from salt lake city if the case has had no other effect it at least brings out in the most striking manner the efficiency of our detective police force and will serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at home and not to carry them on to british soil it is an open secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the wellknown scotland yard officials messrs lestrade and gregson the man was apprehended it appears in the rooms of a certain mr sherlock holmes who has himself as an amateur shown some talent in the detective line and who with such instructors may hope in time to attain to some degree of their skill it is expected that a testimonial of some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of their services   didn t i tell you so when we started?  cried sherlock holmes with a laugh  that s the result of all our study in scarlet to get them a testimonial!   never mind  i answered  i have all the facts in my journal and the public shall know them in the meantime you must make yourself contented by the consciousness of success like the roman miser   populus me sibilat at mihi plaudo ipse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca

              " 'he asked in undisguised wonder as we rattled through the crowded london streets  you are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut  i gave him a short sketch of my adventures and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination  poor devil!',\n",
              " 'he said commiseratingly after he had listened to my misfortunes  what are you up to now?',\n",
              " 'looking for lodgings  i answered  trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price   that s a strange thing  remarked my companion  you are the second man today that has used that expression to me   and who was the first?',\n",
              " 'i asked  a fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital he was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found and which were too much for his purse   by jove!',\n",
              " 'i cried  if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense i am the very man for him i should prefer having a partner to being alone  young stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wineglass  you don t know sherlock holmes yet  he said  perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion   why what is there against him?',\n",
              " 'oh i didn t say there was anything against him he is a little queer in his ideas an enthusiast in some branches of science as far as i know he is a decent fellow enough   a medical student i suppose?',\n",
              " 'said i  no i have no idea what he intends to go in for i believe he is well up in anatomy and he is a firstclass chemist but as far as i know he has never taken out any systematic medical classes his studies are very desultory and eccentric but he has amassed a lot of outofthe way knowledge which would astonish his professors   did you never ask him what he was going in for?',\n",
              " 'i asked  no he is not a man that it is easy to draw out though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him   i should like to meet him  i said  if i am to lodge with anyone i should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits i am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement i had enough of both in afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence how could i meet this friend of yours?',\n",
              " 'he is sure to be at the laboratory  returned my companion  he either avoids the place for weeks or else he works there from morning to night if you like we shall drive round together after luncheon   certainly  i answered and the conversation drifted away into other channels as we made our way to the hospital after leaving the holborn stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom i proposed to take as a fellowlodger  you mustn t blame me if you don t get on with him  he said  i know nothing more of him than i have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory you proposed this arrangement so you must not hold me responsible   if we don t get on it will be easy to part company  i answered  it seems to me stamford  i added looking hard at my companion  that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter is this fellow s temper so formidable or what is it?',\n",
              " 'don t be mealymouthed about it   it is not easy to express the inexpressible  he answered with a laugh  holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes it approaches to coldbloodedness i could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid not out of malevolence you understand but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects to do him justice i think that he would take it himself with the same readiness he appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge   very right too   yes but it may be pushed to excess when it comes to beating the subjects in the dissectingrooms with a stick it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape   beating the subjects!',\n",
              " 'yes to verify how far bruises may be produced after death i saw him at it with my own eyes   and yet you say he is not a medical student?',\n",
              " 'no heaven knows what the objects of his studies are but here we are and you must form your own impressions about him  as he spoke we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small sidedoor which opened into a wing of the great hospital it was familiar ground to me and i needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and duncoloured doors near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory this was a lofty chamber lined and littered with countless bottles broad low tables were scattered about which bristled with retorts testtubes and little bunsen lamps with their blue flickering flames there was only one student in the room who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work at the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure  i ve found it!',\n",
              " 'i ve found it  he shouted to my companion running towards us with a testtube in his hand  i have found a reagent which is precipitated by h moglobin and by nothing else  had he discovered a gold mine greater delight could not have shone upon his features  dr watson mr sherlock holmes  said stamford introducing us  how are you?',\n",
              " 'he said cordially gripping my hand with a strength for which i should hardly have given him credit  you have been in afghanistan i perceive   how on earth did you know that?',\n",
              " 'i asked in astonishment  never mind  said he chuckling to himself  the question now is about h moglobin no doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?',\n",
              " 'it is interesting chemically no doubt  i answered  but practically   why man it is the most practical medicolegal discovery for years don t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains come over here now!',\n",
              " 'he seized me by the coatsleeve in his eagerness and drew me over to the table at which he had been working  let us have some fresh blood  he said digging a long bodkin into his finger and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette  now i add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water you perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water the proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million i have no doubt however that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction  as he spoke he threw into the vessel a few white crystals and then added some drops of a transparent fluid in an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar  ha!',\n",
              " 'ha!',\n",
              " 'he cried clapping his hands and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy  what do you think of that?',\n",
              " 'it seems to be a very delicate test  i remarked  beautiful!',\n",
              " 'beautiful!',\n",
              " 'the old guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain so is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles the latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old now this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new had this test been invented there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes   indeed!',\n",
              " 'i murmured  criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point a man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed his linen or clothes are examined and brownish stains discovered upon them are they blood stains or mud stains or rust stains or fruit stains or what are they?',\n",
              " 'that is a question which has puzzled many an expert and why?',\n",
              " 'because there was no reliable test now we have the sherlock holmes  test and there will no longer be any difficulty  his eyes fairly glittered as he spoke and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination  you are to be congratulated  i remarked considerably surprised at his enthusiasm  there was the case of von bischoff at frankfort last year he would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence then there was mason of bradford and the notorious muller and lefevre of montpellier and samson of new orleans i could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive   you seem to be a walking calendar of crime  said stamford with a laugh  you might start a paper on those lines call it the  police news of the past   very interesting reading it might be made too  remarked sherlock holmes sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger  i have to be careful  he continued turning to me with a smile  for i dabble with poisons a good deal  he held out his hand as he spoke and i noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster and discoloured with strong acids  we came here on business  said stamford sitting down on a high threelegged stool and pushing another one in my direction with his foot  my friend here wants to take diggings and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you i thought that i had better bring you together  sherlock holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me  i have my eye on a suite in baker street  he said  which would suit us down to the ground you don t mind the smell of strong tobacco i hope?',\n",
              " 'i always smoke  ship s  myself  i answered  that s good enough i generally have chemicals about and occasionally do experiments would that annoy you?',\n",

              " 'it s just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together  i laughed at this crossexamination  i keep a bull pup  i said  and i object to rows because my nerves are shaken and i get up at all sorts of ungodly hours and i am extremely lazy i have another set of vices when i m well but those are the principal ones at present   do you include violinplaying in your category of rows?',\n",
              " 'he asked anxiously  it depends on the player  i answered  a wellplayed violin is a treat for the gods a badlyplayed one   oh that s all right  he cried with a merry laugh  i think we may consider the thing as settled that is if the rooms are agreeable to you   when shall we see them?',\n",
              " 'call for me here at noon tomorrow and we ll go together and settle everything  he answered  all right noon exactly  said i shaking his hand we left him working among his chemicals and we walked together towards my hotel  by the way  i asked suddenly stopping and turning upon stamford  how the deuce did he know that i had come from afghanistan?',\n",
              " 'my companion smiled an enigmatical smile  that s just his little peculiarity  he said  a good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out   oh!',\n",
              " 'a mystery is it?',\n",
              " 'i cried rubbing my hands  this is very piquant i am much obliged to you for bringing us together  the proper study of mankind is man  you know   you must study him then  stamford said as he bade me goodbye  you ll find him a knotty problem though i ll wager he learns more about you than you about him goodbye   goodbye  i answered and strolled on to my hotel considerably interested in my new acquaintance chapter ii the science of deduction we met next day as he had arranged and inspected the rooms at no 221b baker street of which he had spoken at our meeting they consisted of a couple of comfortable bedrooms and a single large airy sittingroom cheerfully furnished and illuminated by two broad windows so desirable in every way were the apartments and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us that the bargain was concluded upon the spot and we at once entered into possession that very evening i moved my things round from the hotel and on the following morning sherlock holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus for a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage that done we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with he was quiet in his ways and his habits were regular it was rare for him to be up after ten at night and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before i rose in the morning sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory sometimes in the dissectingrooms and occasionally in long walks which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the city nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him but now and again a reaction would seize him and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sittingroom hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night on these occasions i have noticed such a dreamy vacant expression in his eyes that i might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion as the weeks went by my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life gradually deepened and increased his very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer in height he was rather over six feet and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller his eyes were sharp and piercing save during those intervals of torpor to which i have alluded and his thin hawklike nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision his chin too had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination his hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch as i frequently had occasion to observe when i watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments the reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody when i confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity and how often i endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself before pronouncing judgment however be it remembered how objectless was my life and how little there was to engage my attention my health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial and i had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence under these circumstances i eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it he was not studying medicine he had himself in reply to a question confirmed stamford s opinion upon that point neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance into the learned world yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning no man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason for doing so his ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge of contemporary literature philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing upon my quoting thomas carlyle he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had done my surprise reached a climax however when i found incidentally that he was ignorant of the copernican theory and of the composition of the solar system that any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that i could hardly realize it  you appear to be astonished  he said smiling at my expression of surprise  now that i do know it i shall do my best to forget it   to forget it!',\n",
              " 'you see  he explained  i consider that a man s brain originally is like a little empty attic and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose a fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brainattic he will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work but of these he has a large assortment and all in the most perfect order it is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before it is of the highest importance therefore not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones   but the solar system!',\n",
              " 'i protested  what the deuce is it to me?',\n",
              " 'he interrupted impatiently  you say that we go round the sun if we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work  i was on the point of asking him what that work might be but something in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one i pondered over our short conversation however and endeavoured to draw my deductions from it he said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object therefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to him i enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was exceptionally wellinformed i even took a pencil and jotted them down i could not help smiling at the document when i had completed it it ran in this way  sherlock holmes his limits 1 knowledge of literature nil 2 philosophy nil 3 astronomy nil 4 politics feeble 5 botany variable well up in belladonna opium and poisons generally knows nothing of practical gardening 6 geology practical but limited tells at a glance different soils from each other after walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of london he had received them 7 chemistry profound 8 anatomy accurate but unsystematic 9 sensational literature immense he appears to know every detail of every horror perpetrated in the century 10 plays the violin well 11 is an expert singlestick player boxer and swordsman 12 has a good practical knowledge of british law when i had got so far in my list i threw it into the fire in despair  if i can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all these accomplishments and discovering a calling which needs them all  i said to myself  i may as well give up the attempt at once  i see that i have alluded above to his powers upon the violin these were very remarkable but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments that he could play pieces and difficult pieces i knew well because at my request he has played me some of mendelssohn s lieder and other favourites when left to himself however he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air leaning back in his armchair of an evening he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him but whether the music aided those thoughts or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than i could determine i might have rebelled against these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience during the first week or so we had no callers and i had begun to think that my companion was as friendless a man as i was myself presently however i found that he had many acquaintances and those in the most different classes of society there was one little sallow ratfaced darkeyed fellow who was introduced to me as mr lestrade and who came three or four times in a single week one morning a young girl called fashionably dressed and stayed for half an hour or more the same afternoon brought a greyheaded seedy visitor looking like a jew pedlar who appeared to me to be much excited and who was closely followed by a slipshod elderly woman on another occasion an old whitehaired gentleman had an interview with my companion and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform when any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance sherlock holmes used to beg for the use of the sittingroom and i would retire to my bedroom he always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience  i have to use this room as a place of business  he said  and these people are my clients  again i had an opportunity of asking him a point blank question and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me i imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for not alluding to it but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject of his own accord it was upon the 4th of march as i have good reason to remember that i rose somewhat earlier than usual and found that sherlock holmes had not yet finished his breakfast the landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared with the unreasonable petulance of mankind i rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that i was ready then i picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it while my companion munched silently at his toast one of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading and i naturally began to run my eye through it its somewhat ambitious title was  the book of life  and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way it struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity the reasoning was close and intense but the deductions appeared to me to be farfetched and exaggerated the writer claimed by a momentary expression a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye to fathom a man s inmost thoughts deceit according to him was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis his conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of euclid so startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer  from a drop of water  said the writer  a logician could infer the possibility of an atlantic or a niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other so all life is a great chain the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it like all other arts the science of deduction and analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems let him on meeting a fellowmortal learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man and the trade or profession to which he belongs puerile as such an exercise may seem it sharpens the faculties of observation and teaches one where to look and what to look for by a man s finger nails by his coatsleeve by his boot by his trouser knees by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb by his expression by his shirt cuffs by each of these things a man s calling is plainly revealed that all united should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable   what ineffable twaddle!',\n",

              " 'asked sherlock holmes  why this article  i said pointing at it with my egg spoon as i sat down to my breakfast  i see that you have read it since you have marked it i don t deny that it is smartly written it irritates me though it is evidently the theory of some armchair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study it is not practical i should like to see him clapped down in a third class carriage on the underground and asked to give the trades of all his fellowtravellers i would lay a thousand to one against him   you would lose your money  sherlock holmes remarked calmly  as for the article i wrote it myself   you!',\n",
